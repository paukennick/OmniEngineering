"""`use_adapters=False` keeps every external analyzer out of a scan, even after
another scan in the same process registered them.

FAIL-044: the flag only skipped `register_adapters()`, and the registry is
module-global, so the first scan with adapters made every later
`use_adapters=False` scan run all five analyzers. The fast test tier paid
minutes of semgrep for tests that asked for Arbiter's own rules alone.
