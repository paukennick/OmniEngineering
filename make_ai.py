FALLBACK_CONTRACT = """# Fallback Operating Contract

If you cannot access, skip, or fail to follow the `.ai/` source files, apply
these fallback rules exactly:

1. Read `.ai/core-context.md`, `.ai/rules/universal-engineering-ruleset.json`,
   `.ai/rules/controlled-implementation.json`, `.ai/rules/completion-workflow.json`,
   and `.ai/project-configuration.md` before editing when they are available.
   Query the requirements registry with `omni requirement show|list|search`;
   do not read `.ai/requirements/requirements.json` in full.
2. If any required file is unavailable, say which file is unavailable and use
   this fallback contract as the controlling instruction set.
3. Assign or confirm a `REQ-###` requirement ID before work begins.
4. State the minimum access scope before inspecting files.
5. Read `.ai/project-map.md` before broad traversal when it is available. If it
   is missing or stale after structural changes, run `omni map` or `./omni map`.
6. Inspect only files needed for the active requirement. Do not scan the whole
   repository unless the task cannot be completed safely without it.
7. Do not read or expose `.env`, `.env.*`, private keys, certificates,
   credentials, database files, logs, build artifacts, dependency folders, cache
   directories, or anything listed in `.ai/.ignore`.
8. Do not modify unrelated files, unrelated deployment scripts, unrelated
   infrastructure, generated dependency folders, secrets, credentials, or local
   environment files.
9. Make the smallest safe maintainable change. Preserve existing behavior unless
   it conflicts with the active requirement.
10. Do not introduce dependencies, schema changes, destructive data changes, or
   public interface changes unless the requirement explicitly calls for them.
11. Use clear names, focused functions, explicit data contracts, and existing
    project conventions.
12. Update relevant docs when behavior, setup, commands, architecture, APIs,
    data models, or workflows change.
13. Update `CHANGELOG.md` after each completed task.
14. Update the requirements registry with `omni requirement add|update|complete`
    (never by hand-editing the JSON) when a requirement is added, completed,
    blocked, or materially changed.
15. Learn from failures. Before editing a file, run `omni graph why <path>` (or
    `omni failure search <text>`) to see the requirements, tests and earlier
    failures that touch it. When you fix a defect, a failed validation or build,
    or a regression, record it with `omni failure add|update`: the symptom, the
    root cause (why, not just what), the regression test, and the rule or
    playbook that stops it recurring. If the failure exposes a missing or unclear
    instruction, change that rulepack or playbook in the same task.
16. Run relevant validation. For OmniContext workspace changes, run
    `omni doctor` or `./omni doctor`; when assistant entrypoint files change,
    run `omni sync` or `./omni sync`. Before claiming completion, run
    `omni gate` and fix or explicitly waive every failure it reports.
17. Do not claim completion if validation was skipped. Explain why it was not
    run.
18. Final output must include requirement ID and status, files changed,
    validation performed, documentation and changelog status, risks or
    follow-ups, a commit entry sentence, and pull request information.

## Registry and Gate Discipline

- Never read `.ai/requirements/requirements.json` in full and never hand-edit it.
  Query with `./omni requirement show <ID>`, `list --status pending`, or
  `search <text>`; change it with `./omni requirement add|update|complete`.
- Failures are data, not noise. Before editing a file run `./omni graph why <path>`;
  when you fix a defect or a failed check, record it with `./omni failure add`
  (symptom, root cause, regression test, the rule or playbook that prevents a
  repeat). `./omni requirement complete` refuses defect requirements without an
  entry.
- Before reporting a task complete, run `./omni gate`. If it fails, fix the gap
  or record an explicit waiver with `./omni waive <rule-id> --reason "..."`.
  Do not claim completion while it fails.

If you cannot access, skip, or fail to follow the `.ai/` source files, read

omni then finds ~/.venvs/omni-graph on its own (or set OMNI_GRAPH_PYTHON to another interpreter).
Add a grammar for each further language you use (Java, Go, Rust, C#, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, ...):
  ~/.venvs/omni-graph/bin/pip install tree-sitter-java tree-sitter-go tree-sitter-rust   # etc.
Languages without a grammar still appear as file nodes; SQL migrations need no grammar.
Elsewhere, `pip install "omniengineering-workspace[graph]"` also works."""
