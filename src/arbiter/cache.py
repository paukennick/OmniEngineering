"""Persistent per-file result cache for file-local probes.

## Why this exists

Reading was never the bottleneck -- the in-process read cache in probes.py
proved that -- but analysis is, and every scan paid for all of it again.
The pre-commit gate runs over a tree in which, between one commit and the
next, a handful of files changed. A probe whose answer for a file depends on
that file alone has nothing new to say about the other ten thousand.

## What is cached

One entry per (probe, file): the list of findings that probe produced for
that file, exactly as the probe produced them, BEFORE calibration, severity
overrides, the baseline and suppressions. Those passes run on everything on
every scan, so a verdict recorded yesterday, or a suppression added this
morning, applies to a cached finding the same way it applies to a fresh one.
An empty list is stored too: a file the probe found clean is a hit next time,
which is the common case and the one worth having.

## What the key covers

    sha256( digest(file bytes) ‖ rules hash ‖ repo id ‖ relative path )

where the rules hash is

    sha256( config as sorted JSON ‖ probe.version ‖ Arbiter's version
            ‖ a digest of Arbiter's own source ‖ the probe's context digest )

The config, because a house rule or a threshold is part of the question. The
probe and Arbiter versions, because the question changes between releases.
The source digest, because a developer editing a probe does not bump its
version before rerunning the scan, and a cache that served yesterday's answer
to today's rule would be worse than no cache. The repository id and the path,
because two identical files at different paths are two different findings
and because probes read the path (a credential under `tests/` is reported
differently from one under `src/`). The context digest is whatever a probe
declares its per-file answer depends on OUTSIDE the file -- the manifests,
for a probe that decides whether an import is declared. A probe that depends
on nothing outside the file declares nothing.

## What is never cached

A probe that is not declared `cacheable`. The declaration is a claim that
the probe is file-local, and `tools/integrity.py` (CI-13) tests the claim
by running every cacheable probe on a file alone and beside another file,
and requiring the same answer. Findings that carry no path cannot be
attributed to a file and are never stored. The output of any post-processing
pass is never stored. And CI runs with `--no-cache`: a pull-request gate must
measure the tree in front of it, not remember a previous one.

A missing or corrupt cache file is an empty cache, never an error; a tree
that cannot be written to simply gets no cache. The file is written whole,
to a temporary name and then renamed, so a reader never sees half of one.
