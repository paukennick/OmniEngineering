# REQ-006 was a crash on every adapter timeout on Windows: `os.killpg` does not
# exist there, so the process-group path raised AttributeError and the analyzer
# outlived the timeout that was supposed to stop it. It survived to be found by
# hand because no automation had ever run on Windows, and because the fix --
# `_kill_tree` -- is unreachable on a machine that has process groups.
#
# So there are two halves here and both are needed. The tests below take the
# platform away rather than waiting for a platform, which means the Windows
# branch is exercised on every Linux run too; and the CI matrix makes sure a
# real Windows runner sees the rest of the suite, which no amount of
# monkeypatching can stand in for.
