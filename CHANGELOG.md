# Changelog

## 2026-10-09

### Completed

- `REQ-041` | CI / repo hygiene | What the upstream's first CI run on the pull request reported, fixed:
  every action in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` names its tag's commit SHA with the tag in a trailing
  comment (`actions/checkout` fbc6f399 v5, `actions/setup-python` a26af69b v5, `actions/cache` 0057852b
  v4, `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` 9f759ee6 v3), so the workflow runs what was reviewed
  (FAIL-016); and `arbiter.yaml` suppresses `arbiter/authored.security-check-disabled` on the adopt
  loop's CI script and its test, where `verify=False` is the planted defect the loop proves the gate
  rejects, each with a reason and an expiry, so the scan no longer reports the plant as this
  repository's own and the SARIF upload stops raising it as an alert.

- `REQ-051` | Code understanding | A finding traces to the requirement that introduced its line. `omni graph
  build` blames every finding's line (`git blame --porcelain -L`, one call per distinct file with all of its
  flagged lines, at the commit the report scanned, falling back to HEAD and then the working tree), records
  `attrs.introduced_by_commit` and an `introduced_by` edge to the commit node (created with its `delivers`
  edges when the history layer did not reach it), so the requirement is one hop on. `omni graph why f:<id>`
  prints `introduced by  <commit> <subject> (<requirement>)` under the finding and `omni graph findings`
  prints the same line per finding; a line with no blame (an uncommitted edit, an untracked file, a path
  outside git) reads `introduced by  uncommitted change` and is never an error. The `cites` edges from the
  `req:` tags stay and are labelled as context (being worked when the scan ran), in `why`, the handbook and
  the viewer. The viewer's finding panel gains an "Introduced by" row (commit, subject, the requirements it
  delivers), a "context" row and "Trace to introducing requirement", which draws finding, commit,
  requirement whatever shorter route exists. The browser test builds a real git repository with one commit
  per requirement, the second writing the flagged line, and asserts the row and the three-step trace;
  `tests/test_graph_vendored_and_blame.py` covers blame at the scanned commit, one blame per file, the
  uncommitted and outside-git cases and the printed output. On this repository all 33 findings resolve: the
  stub finding `f:3780e4a24676`, tagged with five requirements, is introduced by b49f2eb (REQ-050).

- `REQ-052` | Code understanding | Vendored workspaces' ledgers and registries join the graph, namespaced.
  Every directory with its own `.ai/omni-version.json` (the `arbiter/` subtree) contributes its
  `requirements.json` and `failure-ledger.json` with the directory as a prefix (`arbiter/ARB-048`,
  `arbiter/FAIL-042`, `attrs.workspace`), hung under the workspace's directory node (root, arbiter,
  failure-ledger.json, arbiter/FAIL-042); the root's ids stay bare, so the two ledgers numbered from FAIL-001
  never collide. `recorded_as` resolves across workspaces by the finding id in `how_detected` (or
  `symptom`); `affected` and `regression_tests` resolve relative to the workspace; an entry's `requirement`
  resolves through the workspace's own registry and `id_aliases`; a commit or `req:` tag that cites a
  vendored id reaches the prefixed node, the root's ids first. `omni graph why arbiter/FAIL-042` and `omni
  graph findings` print the prefixed ids; the viewer shows the workspace on the node, in the tooltip, the
  panel and the breadcrumb, and a search for `FAIL-042` or `arbiter/FAIL-042` finds it. Only the ledger and
  the registry are read, never the workspace's code; doctor stays at 0 errors. The handbook states the
  convention: a ledger entry names the finding id (`f:...`) in `how_detected`. On this repository 26
  requirements and 41 failures of `arbiter/` joined the graph and 8 subtree commits now deliver their
  `arbiter/ARB-###`.

- `REQ-047` | Developer tooling | `completion.tests` is `required`: `omni gate` runs `omni test run --impacted`,
  so the registered suites the change reaches must pass (nothing to run, and a pass, when no suite is
  registered). Each `command` rule that passed is memoised in the gate state file (`.git/omni-gate-last.json`)
  on its scoped change set (the changed paths its own globs select via `arbiter_rule_scope`, their mtimes and
  sizes, and the rendered run text); the next `omni gate`, hook or not, reports it as `passed (memo)` and does
  not re-run it until a scoped file changes. A failed or waived rule is never memoised; `omni gate --no-memo`
  forces every rule; the non-hook output prints each command rule's duration (`ran     completion.tests
  144.1s PASS`). `omni` in a rule's run text resolves to the CLI beside `make_ai.py`, so the rule works where
  `omni` is not on PATH (an adopted repository, CI). The adopt loop (CI and `tests/test_adopt_loop.py`) asserts
  the tests rule runs and passes with no suites while `completion.arbiter_gate` still fails alone, and runs
  again after the fix. On a change touching `make_ai.py` the gate took 175.6 s cold and 6.4 s warm.

- `REQ-049` | CLI / template maintainability | `omni arbiter sync [--source URL] [--branch main]
  [--skip-baseline] [--dry-run]` levels the vendored subtree, the installed package, the recorded version and
  the baseline in one command: in subtree mode `git subtree pull --prefix=arbiter <source> <branch>` (`--squash`
  when the history was pulled that way), `pip install -e ./arbiter[mcp]`, the version record, `omni arbiter
  baseline` (`--refresh` when one exists) and `omni doctor`; in pip mode `pip --upgrade` from the recorded
  source, then the same tail. Each step is printed before it runs, the first non-zero exit stops the sequence
  naming the step and what to do (a subtree conflict: resolve, commit, rerun), `--dry-run` prints the commands
  only; a recorded local path inside the repository falls back to the upstream URL. Doctor warns, never errors,
  when a commit since the gate base (the last 20 without one, merges skipped) carries an author or committer
  email other than `git config user.email` or a `.local`/`localhost` domain, naming the commit, the email and
  the fix (`git commit --amend --reset-author`, or a rebase); a repository with no configured email skips the
  check, so the adopt loop stays quiet.

- `REQ-046` | Developer tooling | The Posture line reads two Arbiter reports, not one. The gate's `--changed`
  run is a partial scan whose grade is withheld by design, so the line read "grade withheld (coverage 15%)".
  `arbiter_report_state` now returns `full` (the newest report with `scan_scope.mode: full`: grade, coverage,
  existing high+, when it ran) and `gate` (the newest partial one: verdict, new high+, freshness judged against
  the rule's scope) beside `wired`; `newest_arbiter_report` takes a mode filter and reads the `--out`
  directory's parent and one level below it, so `arbiter-out/baseline/` and `arbiter-out/omni-gate/` are read
  together. The line says which is which (`arbiter score 86.5 (coverage 99%, full scan 2026-10-09 08:51) ·
  gate passed (new high+ 0, fresh)`) and names the command that makes a missing report (`run ./omni arbiter
  baseline`, `run ./omni gate`). `omni doctor --json` is `schema_version` 2 with `posture.arbiter.full` and
  `.gate`; the schema 1 keys stay at the top of `posture.arbiter` for one release, filled from the gate block.
  `omni requirement complete` keeps judging the gate report and falls back to the full scan when there is none.

- `REQ-050` | Developer tooling | Doctor's live MCP probe is memoised and `omni gate` uses the memo. `omni
  gate` ran both MCP servers for real on every commit (2 s of the doctor's 2.5 s). A successful probe of a
  stdio server is now stored in the git directory beside the gate's own state (`omni-mcp-probe.json`, never
  tracked), keyed on the sha256 of `.mcp.json`, `PATH` and the server's resolved executable (path, mtime,
  size), with the probe time, server name and tool names; a matching record younger than 24 hours stands in
  for the launch and the doctor line reads `(probed <time>, run omni doctor --probe to re-check)`. `omni doctor
  --probe` forces a live probe and refreshes the memo, `omni gate` never forces one, a failed probe is never
  remembered, remote (`url`) servers are unchanged, and `OMNI_DOCTOR_NO_MEMO=1` turns the memo off. A warm
  `omni doctor` takes 0.35 s instead of 2.2 s.

- `REQ-048` | CI / repo hygiene | The viewer is exercised in a browser. `tests/test_viewer_browser.py` builds a
  graph from a fixture repository plus a synthetic Arbiter report, renders the viewer with `omni graph view
  --all --mode 2d`, opens it in headless Chromium through Playwright, switches to the Findings tab, lists both
  findings through the search, selects one and asserts the `path:line` source row and the breadcrumb
  (directory, file, symbol, finding), traces it to its requirement and the other to its failure-ledger entry,
  switches the colour mode to severity against the exported `meta.finding_colors`, and fails on any console
  error; the viewer's window API gains `colorMode` and `nodeColor(id)` so canvas colours can be read back. The
  test skips without Playwright, a launchable Chromium or the `[graph]` extra; a new `viewer-browser` CI job
  (ubuntu, Python 3.12, `playwright==1.63.0`, Chromium cached by Playwright version, install retried once)
  runs it for real. The handbook says the trace is proven in a browser.

- `REQ-045` | Documentation | The integration handbook `docs/arbiter-integration.md` (division of
  labour, the three topologies, the wiring written at install, the edit-to-adjudication loop, findings in
  the graph and the four tracing axes, impact and test selection, PR output, what each CI job proves,
  keeping both level, requirement ids across the two, the off switches) and the dated release notes
  `docs/release-notes-2026-10-09.md`, linked from the README (a new Arbiter section after Quick Start
  and the design list), the Arbiter section and `.ai/context-brief.md`; `docs/` is an allowed root path.
  - The documents now say in full what the integration put into the tree. The release notes list
    REQ-035 (the subtree itself) and REQ-045, which they had left out, give ARB-044 its own row, count
    FAIL-015 among the defects, and end with a table of every path the integration added with the
    requirement each came by, plus the commands that did not exist before. The README's Arbiter section
    carries the same inventory in one list, and its License section states the `arbiter/` exclusion that
    `NOTICE` and `LICENSES/README.md` already did.

- `REQ-041` | CI / repo hygiene | The adopt loop is proven end to end. A CI job and
  `tests/test_adopt_loop.py` adopt the workspace with Arbiter into an empty directory, commit, plant
  `requests.get(url, verify=False)`, prove `omni gate` exits 1 with `completion.arbiter_gate` as the
  only failing rule, fix it, and prove the gate passes; the test skips without `arbiter` and prints
  every transcript on an unexpected result. CI uploads the gate's SARIF to code scanning
  (`continue-on-error`; the gate's exit code stays the verdict) and reads Arbiter's Python floor from
  `arbiter/pyproject.toml` instead of hard-coding 3.11. Found and fixed on the way: `omni adopt
  --include-cli` into an empty target always exited 1 because the graph-viewer files were counted as
  already present once `.ai` had been copied in the same run (FAIL-015).

- `REQ-044` | CLI / template maintainability | Requirement id aliases and `omni requirement renumber
  --prefix NEW`. Two workspaces on the `REQ` prefix collide the moment one is vendored into the other
  (each registry had reached number 035 with a different requirement). The registry gains an optional `id_aliases` map (old id to new id) that the
  gate's requirement-id check, `requirement show/update/complete/archive`, `failure add/update/check`
  and doctor resolve; doctor errors on an alias that points nowhere or that is still a live id.
  `renumber` changes the prefix, renumbers the registry and archive keeping the numbers, writes the
  aliases, rewrites `requirement` fields in the ledger and the waiver file, and rewrites references in
  governance text only (`.ai`, root and docs markdown, `.claude`), never in code, tests, vendored
  workspaces or git history; `--dry-run` previews, a second run is a no-op.

- `REQ-043` | Code understanding | Arbiter findings are graph nodes. `omni graph build` reads the newest
  report under the `completion.arbiter_gate` rule's output directory (or `findings_report` in
  `graph-config.json`; `null` disables) and adds one `finding` node per unsuppressed finding with
  `flags` edges to the file and the symbol whose span covers the line, `cites` edges to the requirements
  its `req:` tags name, `recorded_as` edges to the ledger entry whose `how_detected` carries its id, and
  directory `contains` edges so the tree reads root to finding. Only id, location, rule, dimension,
  severity, status, tags and title are copied; evidence never reaches the graph. `omni graph why f:<id>`,
  `omni graph findings [--under DIR] [--dimension D] [--severity S] [--depth N] [--tree|--json] [--view]`,
  the `graph_findings` MCP tool and `graph view --focus f:<id>` trace a finding by id, category, severity,
  depth and directory. The viewer gains a Findings tab (tree layout, coloured by category), `dimension`
  and `severity` colour modes, a findings filter, `severity:` / `dim:` / `rule:` search terms, and a
  finding detail panel with the source `path:line`, a copy button, an editor link, one-click traces to
  the requirement or failure, and the `arbiter review` command to adjudicate it.

- `REQ-042` | CLI / template maintainability | `arbiter_install` records the installed Arbiter under
  `arbiter` in `.ai/omni-version.json` (`write_omni_version_file` now preserves keys it does not own);
  doctor warns when the installed version differs; `omni update` warns when the installed
  `completion.arbiter_gate` rule drifted from the template; `omni arbiter update [--source] [--keep-rule]
  [--squash] [--force] [--skip-pip] [--dry-run]` upgrades the package, rewrites the rule, pulls a
  vendored subtree (refusing to mix squash modes unless forced, detected from the last
  `git-subtree-dir` commit), re-records the version and suggests a baseline refresh.

- `REQ-040` | Executable validation | `omni test run [NAMES] [--impacted] [--changed BASE] [--json]
  [--timeout]` runs registered suites at the root and reports PASS, FAIL, SKIP or TIMEOUT with the last
  lines; `--impacted` selects the suites whose paths intersect the change's impact set and runs all
  suites, with a note, when no graph exists; names override `--impacted`. The completion rulepack gains
  a recommended `completion.tests` example rule that adopters promote to required.

- `REQ-039` | Code understanding | `omni graph impact [--changed BASE] [--depth N] [--json]` resolves
  the changed set like the gate, walks the governance, history, assurance and workspace edges (never
  code edges, never `follows`) and buckets what it reaches: requirements, changelog entries, failures,
  test files, suites, rules and commits, each with the hop count and the edge it came by. `omni gate`
  prints the one-line summary when the graph exists; the `omni` MCP server exposes `graph_impact`.

- `REQ-038` | Feature | A committed Arbiter baseline. `arbiter_install` cuts `.arbiter/baseline.json`
  from a full offline scan when `arbiter` is on PATH and says to commit it; the generated
  `completion.arbiter_gate` rule now passes `--baseline .arbiter/baseline.json` and asks for
  `json,sarif,pr-comment` output, so `new: high` means new since the baseline; `omni arbiter baseline
  [--refresh] [--force]` re-baselines only when the last gate passed, refuses partial-scan reports and
  prunes ids that vanished; doctor warns when the rule exists without a baseline, when the baseline
  predates the newest fixed ledger entry, or when its config hash no longer matches `arbiter.yaml`.

- `REQ-037` | Enforcement | `omni requirement complete` refuses, naming `./omni gate`, while the
  completion rulepack carries `completion.arbiter_gate` and the newest report under its output directory
  is missing, was not scanned at HEAD, is older than the newest changed file, or failed; `arbiter` not
  installed refuses first. `--no-arbiter-check REASON` (ten characters or more) records the reason in
  the note.

- `REQ-036` | Doctor / drift detection | `omni doctor` ends with a `Posture:` line after the unchanged
  `Result:` line: the newest Arbiter report (score or withheld, coverage, new high-or-above, gate
  result, fresh or stale with the reason), open or mitigated failures, and open requirements by status.
  `omni doctor --json` (also `validate --json`) emits the whole report with `schema_version: 1` as the
  stable contract. Doctor errors on a requirement id shared between the root registry, its archive and
  a vendored workspace registry, naming both files.

- `REQ-034` | Process | A vendored workspace is recognised, not fought. A directory below the root that
  carries its own `.ai/omni-version.json` (the `arbiter` subtree on the `arbiter` branch, a monorepo
  package, an adopter checked in beside the template) is a workspace of its own: the requirement-id gate
  accepts ids from its registry, so a `git subtree pull` whose commits cite `REQ-0xx` no longer needs a
  waiver here; `omni doctor` warns when its copies of the CLI differ from this checkout's and names the
  `omni update` command that brings them level; and CI gains a job that runs a vendored Arbiter's own
  suite, claim-integrity and mutation checks whenever `arbiter/pyproject.toml` exists, so the copy
  cannot rot unnoticed. Dependency folders (`vendor/`, `node_modules/`) are never read as workspaces.
  - Also restored `withdrawn` in the requirements schema enum. REQ-031 added it to the CLI vocabulary and
    meant to add it to the schema, but that edit was overwritten before the commit and the test guarding
    the two (`test_schema_enum_matches_the_cli_vocabulary`) was misread as the known environment failure
    in the hook test. Recorded as FAIL-011: from now on a failing suite is read by test name, never by
    count.
  - CI also runs on pushes to the `arbiter` branch, so the vendored-Arbiter job exercises the subtree
    there without a pull request.
  - The main matrix installs a vendored Arbiter when `arbiter/pyproject.toml` exists, because doctor
    starts the `arbiter mcp` server the branch registers and the gate runs `arbiter gate`; the first run
    on the `arbiter` branch failed all six matrix jobs on exactly that live check.
  - That install only happens on Python 3.11+, which Arbiter requires: on 3.10 the unit tests still run
    and the doctor and gate steps are skipped with a note (both run on every 3.12 cell). The second run
    on the `arbiter` branch had failed the 3.10 cells on the install itself and the 3.12 cells on
    `arbiter gate` reading two of its own earlier reports that had been committed before `arbiter-out/`
    was ignored: those are untracked there now and the lesson is FAIL-012.

- `REQ-035` | Process | Arbiter published into this repository on the `arbiter` branch, as a git subtree
  under `arbiter/` with its full history (`git subtree pull --prefix=arbiter ... main` takes later
  changes). The branch allows `arbiter` as a root path, exempts `arbiter/**` from the `data.privacy`
  content check (Arbiter's fixture corpus is planted secrets by design), keeps `arbiter/` out of this
  repository's code graph (the subtree has its own), states at the root that the Apache-2.0 grant does not
  extend to `arbiter/`, and wires Arbiter to gate this repository too: `arbiter gate . --changed` runs
  inside `omni gate`, and the `arbiter` MCP server is registered beside `omni`. Merged into `main` on
  2026-10-09 (pull request #3) once the whole loop was green on both sides.

- `REQ-033` | Feature | Arbiter installs alongside the workspace.
  - `omni adopt --with-arbiter [SOURCE]` and, for a repository adopted earlier, `omni arbiter install
    --source SOURCE` pip-install `arbiter-eval[mcp]` (editable from a local checkout, or from the GitHub
    URL by default) and write the wiring the two tools need to meet: the `arbiter` server in `.mcp.json`,
    a `completion.arbiter_gate` rule of type `command` in the completion rulepack so `omni gate` runs
    `arbiter gate --changed <base>`, a starter `arbiter.yaml`, and `arbiter-out/` in `.gitignore`. Each
    step is skipped when already present and nothing is overwritten, so the command is safe to rerun;
    `--skip-pip` writes the wiring only and `--dry-run` reports it. The arbiter repository itself was the
    first consumer, by hand, in its REQ-031 and REQ-032; this makes the same wiring one command for every
    other adopter.

- `REQ-032` | Feature | The gate can run the project's own check, and defect work is recognised by a
  configurable pattern.
  - A fourth validation type, `command`: `{"type": "command", "run": "arbiter gate --changed {base}",
    "when_changed": ["src/**"], "timeout": 600}` runs a scanner, a test suite or a linter as part of
    `omni gate` whenever a changed path matches. `run` is split like a shell line, `{base}` is the gate's
    base commit, and a non-zero exit, a timeout, or an executable missing from `PATH` all fail the rule with
    the last lines of output attached -- an unrunnable check is not a pass. The first consumer is the arbiter
    adopter, whose `arbiter gate` now runs inside `omni gate`, so the workspace enforces the product's own
    standard instead of only the changelog and registry co-change.
  - `omni requirement complete` decided whether a requirement was defect work (and so needs a failure-ledger
    entry) with a hardcoded regex over the category name. A project whose categories are `developer-tooling`
    or `compliance` never triggered it. `configuration.defect_category_pattern` in the ruleset now overrides
    that regex; the default is unchanged and an invalid pattern falls back to it.

- `REQ-031` | Feature | Two improvements ported back from the arbiter adopter's fork of `make_ai.py`.
  - A requirement can now be `withdrawn`: a terminal status like `completed`, for work that was decided
    against rather than finished. `omni requirement archive` moves every withdrawn entry along with the
    completed ones older than `--keep-recent`, and `--id REQ-001,REQ-002` archives exactly the named entries,
    refusing a pending, blocked or proposed one outright (exit 1, nothing written) instead of silently hiding
    live work from every session that loads the registry. The schema enum and the ruleset's requirement
    template name the new status.
  - `omni doctor` checks `.mcp.json` by starting the servers it registers, not by reading the file: each stdio
    server is launched with its configured command, args and env, taken through the real `initialize` and
    `tools/list` handshake over newline-delimited JSON-RPC, and must answer with at least one tool within 30s.
    A registration that looks right but no longer starts (an SDK whose shape moved, an entry point renamed, a
    command not on PATH) is exactly the failure a static check cannot see, and the assistant would otherwise
    fall back to shelling out without saying so. Remote `url` servers are reported as not probed. `.mcp.json`
    is now an allowed root file. Tests exercise the probe against `omni mcp serve` itself, so the server and
    the check are verified against each other.
  - Two graph fixes found while re-syncing the arbiter adopter: `exclude_code_globs` in `.ai/graph-config.json`
    keeps named directories (test corpora with planted defects, vendored examples, generated output) out of
    the code layer while they stay tracked and readable, so their symbols are never attributed to the project;
    and a changelog that keeps dated `###` sections under one `## [Unreleased]` heading now yields one dated
    entry per section instead of a single undated block. `omni doctor` also stopped reporting the requirements
    registry as "partially readable" whenever an unrelated earlier check had failed.

## 2026-09-22

### Completed

- `REQ-030` | Defect | `FAIL-009`. Fixed CI: graph build needs tree-sitter for every language, python
  included -- there is no stdlib-ast fallback anywhere in this codebase.
  - The CI matrix's main test job (deliberately no `[graph]` extra) failed 6/6: `parse_python_file()`
    calls `load_language("python")` unconditionally, so plain Python parsing has always required
    tree-sitter, contrary to `build_graph()`'s own stats, which defaulted the mode label to the literal
    string `"ast"` (a lie; fixed to `"tree-sitter"`). That mislabel is exactly what let this development
    machine's local test runs go green: `~/.venvs/omni-graph` was always silently auto-detected and
    re-exec'd into, so the true no-extras path was never actually exercised here, only in CI.
  - Fixed `tests/test_benchmark.py::TestBenchmarkCLI`'s two failing tests to pass `--graph` at a
    hand-built fixture graph (the same pattern `TestBenchmark` already uses) instead of invoking a real
    `omni graph build`, so they need no extra. Skipped the one test that must run a real build when
    tree-sitter is unavailable, and the `graph-extra` CI job (which does install the extra) now also
    runs the full test suite, so that skipped test is exercised there instead.
  - Also fixed a genuine test race the extras-installed run then surfaced: the lock directory's removal
    (an `EXIT` trap on the backgrounded subshell) can land a moment after the graph file itself appears,
    so the test now polls briefly for the lock's release too, rather than checking exactly once.
  - Reproduced locally by overriding `HOME` for the test subprocess so `~/.venvs/omni-graph` is not
    found, matching CI's real environment -- the only reliable way this machine can exercise the true
    no-extras path, since the auto-detection is silent by design.
  - `FAIL-010`. The first push of this fix then broke the workflow file itself: a step name containing
    an unquoted colon (`"...extra: the tests..."`) parses as a nested YAML mapping, not plain text.
    Quoted it, and validated with a local YAML parse before pushing again.

- `REQ-029` | Feature | `omni graph benchmark`: measure the token-savings claim instead of just asserting it.
  - For one real requirement, commit, failure and file the current project's own graph and registries
    already have (never invented, never hardcoded to a specific project's IDs), it runs a targeted graph
    query against the naive alternative -- a plain-text grep for the name, then every matching file read
    in full; a commit compares against `git show`, the diff a person would actually read -- and reports
    both sizes. Tokens are `chars / 4`, explicitly labelled a rough estimate, not a real tokenizer.
  - Found and fixed while building it: the file case first picked a 290 MB gitignored `.expo` build log
    (a generic `file` graph node existed for it despite being gitignored), then a 5.5 MB `.pptx` once
    that was excluded. Fixed by restricting the pick to git-tracked, already-parsed source modules only
    -- never a generic file node, which can be a binary asset or an ignored artifact.
  - Live runs after the fix: 88x-630x on this workspace's host project, 40x-91x on OmniEngineering's own
    repository.

- `REQ-028` | Process | A dead rule validation fixed, and one new honest one added.
  - `gate_rules()` only ever selected `validation.type == "co_changed"`, so `controlled.requirement_id`'s
    declared `requirement_registry_entry` validation was silently never executed -- a rule that looked
    machine-checked but was not. Implemented it for real: every `REQ-###`-shaped ID cited in a commit
    message since the base, or newly added to `CHANGELOG.md`, must exist in the registry.
  - Added `content_forbidden`, applied to `data.privacy`: changed files are scanned for a private-key
    header, an AWS-shaped access key, and an obviously hardcoded credential, with a line number. A
    bounded, honest safety net, not a claim of exhaustive secret scanning.
  - Deliberately left the other ~55 unvalidated rules alone: cognitive load, composition vs.
    inheritance, naming, and the like are real judgment calls with no honest mechanical proxy, and a
    fake check would be worse than the current honest "not machine-checked."
  - `EXECUTABLE_VALIDATION_TYPES` now names the matched pair (selection in `gate_rules()`, dispatch in
    `gate_evaluate()`) so a new type added to only one of them fails loudly instead of silently doing
    nothing -- the exact shape of the bug this fixes.

- `REQ-027` | Feature | An MCP server: the graph and registries as tools for any assistant, not only Claude.
  - `omni mcp serve` exposes `graph_lineage`, `graph_why`, `graph_trace`, `graph_timeline`, `graph_show`,
    `graph_sources`, `requirement_show`, `requirement_list`, `requirement_search`, `failure_show` and
    `gate_status` as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited).
    `omni mcp tools [--json]` lists them without starting the server.
  - Hand-rolled against the wire protocol in stdlib only, no SDK dependency, in keeping with everything
    else here: an assistant reaches this project's requirements, changelog, commits, tests and failures
    directly, without a shell tool to run the CLI and parse its output -- and without being Claude.
  - Every tool is read-only, so a client calls them with no confirmation step; `gate_status` runs the
    same check as `omni gate` but never writes a waiver or blocks anything. Writing stays with
    `omni requirement draft`/`add` and `omni gate --hook`.
  - Added to the root allowlist, the `omni adopt`/`omni update` copy list and `pyproject.toml`'s
    `py-modules`, all three caught missing it on the first build (`omni doctor` flagged the first).

- `REQ-026` | Process | Two fewer manual steps: drafting a requirement, and keeping the graph fresh.
  - `omni requirement draft [--commit REF]` writes a `proposed` requirement (never `completed`) and a
    matching `CHANGELOG.md` stub from the files a commit or the current change set touched: category
    guessed from the paths, title from the commit subject, scope from the diff. It refuses to draft a
    duplicate when the commit message already cites a requirement ID (`--force` overrides). The manual
    step becomes editing a draft, not writing one from nothing.
  - `omni hook install-git --with-graph-rebuild` adds a `post-commit` hook that rebuilds the graph in
    the background after every commit, so `omni graph why`/`lineage`/`timeline` are never more than one
    commit stale. It never blocks `git commit` (a full rebuild can take well over a minute on a large
    repo) and a lock directory skips a rebuild that overlaps one already running instead of piling up.

- `REQ-025` | Process | Enforcement no longer depends on Claude Code, and CI checks more than `omni doctor`.
  - `omni hook install-git` writes a portable `.githooks/pre-commit` script and sets
    `core.hooksPath=.githooks`, so `git commit` itself runs `omni gate` — for any assistant, or none,
    on Linux, macOS or Windows (Git for Windows always runs hooks through its own bundled `sh`, so the
    same script works there unmodified). A foreign pre-commit hook is left alone unless `--force` is
    given. The Claude Code Stop hook (`omni hook install`) still exists alongside it.
  - CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) now runs the full test suite, `omni doctor` and `omni gate` on
    `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest` and `windows-latest` across Python 3.10 and 3.12, invoked as plain
    `python <script>` so it depends on neither the executable bit nor which of `python`/`python3` is on
    `PATH`. A separate job installs the optional `[graph]` extra and runs `omni graph build` and
    `omni graph view`, so that path is checked too, not just the extras-free core.

## 2026-09-21

### Completed

- `REQ-024` | Code understanding | Pick any node and trace it up and down: no start and end point needed.
  - `omni graph lineage <node>` (and the viewer's selection) shows everything **upstream** (what led to
    a node) and everything **downstream** (what came from it) from one pick: a requirement, commit,
    change-log entry, failure, file or symbol. Selecting a requirement no longer falls back to its
    immediate neighbours.
  - Every edge type has a flow direction (intent, then delivery, then code, then assurance), so a
    requirement reaches its commits, change-log entries, files and failures, and a failure reaches
    its requirement, cause, regression tests, prevention rules and fix commits.
  - Bounded and readable: `--depth`, a node cap that keeps the nearest first, a module's contents are
    listed only when you start inside that code (a requirement shows its modules, not 240 functions),
    and sequence links such as the previous commit stop after one step. `--code` adds calls and imports.
  - Viewer: upstream lights up cyan and downstream gold, with Up / Both / Down, a depth choice and
    clickable lists in the detail panel. A test keeps the viewer's flow table identical to the CLI's.

- `REQ-023` | Code understanding | The graph viewer is easier to use and no longer needs a GPU.
  - **2D view** (new, and the default): a flat Canvas 2D drawing with pan and zoom that never
    tilts and creates no WebGL context, so it works on machines with little video memory. A large
    2D / 3D switch sits in the banner; the 3D renderer is created only when chosen and destroyed when
    you go back. `omni graph view --mode 2d|3d|auto`.
  - **Views instead of layer switches**: tabs for Everything, Code, Requirements, History, Tests &
    failures, Rules & playbooks and Database, each with its own layers, colours and layout. A strip
    below them names the current view in large type, describes it, and shows a colour key with counts.
    Layers now have strong distinct hues; 2D nodes also have per-kind shapes.
  - **2D layouts**: Network, Layers (one band per layer, parents beside children) and Tree
    (parent to child, unattached nodes grouped by kind).
  - **Chain highlight**: selecting a node draws everything above and below it in gold and zooms to that
    chain; the detail panel shows a breadcrumb and "connected to" buttons grouped by layer.
  - **Trace a path** between any two nodes, drawn in pink with the steps written out.
  - **Search**: multi-word, `kind:` / `layer:` / `lang:` / `file:` filters, keyboard navigation,
    per-result trace buttons, and closest-match suggestions.
  - **Comfort**: collapsible menus (remembered), a tooltip on every option, All / None on filters,
    and a soft-grey light theme.
  - Verified in headless Chromium against a real 6,980-node graph: no console errors; 2D holds no WebGL
    context and 3D releases it on switching back; chain, trace, search, tooltips, collapsing, both themes
    and all three layouts exercised; showing about 4,100 nodes / 12,800 links settled in under 3 seconds.
    80 automated tests (8 new for the template and the generated page). Not verified on a real Windows
    browser or touch device (pinch zoom is implemented but untested), and the tree layout is
    best on graphs with real containment (files, classes, methods).

## 2026-09-20

### Completed

- `REQ-022` | Code understanding | The code graph now has five layers, and the
  history of the project (requirements, changelog, commits, tests, failures, and
  the rules that came out of them) is one traversable structure that works for any
  project.
  - **Layers.** `code`, `governance` (requirements, changelog entries),
    `history` (every commit, chained in order, tied to the changelog entry whose
    heading it added, the requirement named in its subject, and the files it
    changed; a squash commit with no id is tied through its changelog entry),
    `assurance` (the project's tests, test suites, the failure ledger) and
    `workspace` (rulepacks, rules, playbooks, checklists, and OmniEngineering's own
    code). Requirements `touch` the files they declare and the files their commits
    changed, ranked git-proven first and directory-wide last.
  - **Test suites, focused on the host project.** `.ai/test-suites.json`
    registers suites (paths as files, directories or globs; framework; run
    command; what they cover) with `omni test detect|add|remove|list|check`.
    Detection reads test-framework signals in file contents (never comments, never
    `src/main`) and the commands CI files run, so JUnit, Vitest, Jest, pytest,
    Playwright, and validation scripts are found; a registered suite wins over a
    detected one. Suites become `suite` nodes that `contain` their test files and
    `cover` code. OmniEngineering's own files (`tooling_paths`) move to the
    workspace layer and are never counted as the project's tests.
  - **Failure ledger** (`.ai/failures/failure-ledger.json`,
    `omni failure add|update|show|list|search|check`): symptom, root cause,
    regression test or suite, prevention. `omni doctor` fails an incomplete fixed
    entry; `omni requirement complete` refuses defect requirements with no entry.
  - **Traversal.** `omni graph why <file|symbol|REQ|FAIL|commit|suite>` joins the
    layers and flags code no test reaches; `omni graph timeline <node>` lists
    everything dated that is tied to it, oldest first; `show --all --layer`.
  - **Works on any project.** Optional `.ai/graph-config.json` (requirement and
    changelog locations, test globs, ledger and registry paths, extra CI files,
    history depth, tooling paths); requirement ids are matched exactly as they
    appear in the project's own registry, so `PROJ-12`, `FEAT_7` and `REQ-001`
    all work; dated, versioned (`## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-31`) and `# 2026-01-31`
    changelogs parse; no `.ai/`, no git, no commits, a shallow clone, a subfolder
    of a larger repository, unicode paths and symlink loops each degrade to a
    clear note; malformed JSON is reported by file instead of ignored.
    `omni graph sources` shows what each layer would read and what is missing;
    `--write` drafts the config.
  - **Viewer.** A larger banner; All/None on the Layers, Node kinds, Languages and
    Edge types groups; a Node kinds filter; five layer planes when stacked; and a
    new search: any name, `REQ-###`, date, file or text, limited to a kind, sorted
    by match, date, name or connections, with a scrollable result list, a browse
    mode that lists every node of a kind, and Add all to view / Only these.
  - **Rules and playbooks.** `completion.failure_ledger`, `completion.regression_test`,
    `completion.failure_becomes_rule`, `completion.register_test_suites`,
    `completion.verify_target_environment`, `completion.rebuild_graph_layers` and
    `controlled.consult_failure_history`, with matching steps in the debugging,
    testing, implementation, review, planning, handoff and release playbooks, both
    checklists and every assistant entrypoint. `omni adopt` ships an empty ledger,
    an empty suite registry and no graph config.
  - **Tests.** `tests/` holds the first automated suite (72 unittest cases: the
    layers, ledger, `why`/`timeline`, suites and detection, the CLI gates, and a
    robustness matrix of awkward projects). The ledger records eight real failures
    from this work (`FAIL-001` to `FAIL-008`), six with regression tests.
  - Verified on STEP_App (6,804 nodes, 27,378 edges: 166 requirements, 168
    changelog entries, 298 commits over three months, 6 detected test suites, 57
    rules) and on this repository, with `omni graph why`/`timeline` on real files,
    mutation-checking that tests fail when behaviour breaks, and the viewer driven
    in headless Chromium (search by kind, browse, sort, All/None, layer stacking).
    Not verified in a real Windows Chrome or with hardware WebGL. Test detection is
    signal- and convention-based, so an unusual test layout needs a registered
    suite or a `test_globs` entry; `verifies` edges are inferred from calls and
    imports at test-file granularity.

## 2026-09-18 (6)

### Completed

- `REQ-021` | Code understanding | Follow-up: the code graph is no longer limited
  to Python and JS/TS. A generic, grammar-driven tree-sitter extractor covers
  Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, C#, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Scala and others
  (classes, interfaces, methods, imports, inheritance/implements, typed calls,
  cross-file resolution; Java also records Spring annotations and endpoints).
  `omni graph build` now defaults to `--languages auto` and prints a
  per-language summary; a language with no installed grammar still appears as
  file-level nodes. Flyway SQL migrations are replayed in version order into a
  table/column/foreign-key schema (`table` nodes, `references` edges, JPA
  entities linked with `maps_to`), with new `omni graph schema [--table T]
  [--format text|mermaid|json]` and a Schema button in the viewer. Also fixed a
  literal `\u2264` in the viewer's name-labels checkbox. Verified against the
  STEP_App repository (5,881 nodes / 19,421 edges; Java, TypeScript, SQL, C/C++,
  Kotlin, bash) with a real build, `show --all --language sql`,
  `graph schema --table app_user` and the viewer in headless Chromium (no
  console errors). Not verified in a real Windows Chrome. Unusual DDL (functions,
  vendor extensions) is skipped by the SQL parser.

## 2026-09-18 (5)

### Completed

- `REQ-021` | Code understanding | The 3D graph viewer is now branded and readable
  at distance. It is titled "OmniEngineering CodeGraph" with the brand mark, and
  the UI chrome uses the brand palette (`#e0475c` on `#0f0f12`, `#e8e8e8` text,
  Share Tech Mono stack from `assets/brand`) instead of the gold accents it had
  drifted into. Perspective used to shrink far-away nodes to specks and edges to
  hairlines, so nodes farther from the core cluster now grow (by distance from the
  median centre) and both nodes and edge cylinders are compensated by camera
  distance; edges use brighter colours (white calls, teal imports, red inherits,
  grey defines) and a new "Edge strength" slider; while a node is selected,
  unrelated nodes shrink and its own edges turn bold white. Verified against the
  real 2,392-node graph in headless Chromium at 1600x1000 with no console errors;
  not verified in a real Windows Chrome or with hardware WebGL.

## 2026-09-18 (4)

### Completed

- `REQ-021` | Code understanding | Follow-up: `omni graph view` opens correctly
  from WSL. It printed the Linux `file:///mnt/c/...` URL as the main link, which
  a Windows browser cannot resolve, and `--open` used a Linux-side launcher. It
  now detects WSL (`wslpath -w`), prints the `file:///C:/...` URL (UNC and
  space-containing paths are handled) plus the plain Windows path, and `--open`
  launches the default Windows browser via `cmd.exe /c start`. The page itself was
  checked for JavaScript errors and layout at 1600x1000, 1280x720 and 700x900 in
  headless Chromium (none). Not verified in a real Windows Chrome or with
  hardware WebGL.

## 2026-09-18 (3)

### Completed

- `REQ-021` | Code understanding | Follow-up: `omni graph build` no longer
  dead-ends on PEP 668 systems. When tree-sitter is missing it looks for
  `~/.venvs/omni-graph/bin/python` (or the interpreter in `OMNI_GRAPH_PYTHON`)
  and, if that has the packages, re-runs itself under it (guarded by an
  environment variable so it cannot loop); otherwise it prints the
  virtualenv setup commands instead of a `pip install` the OS refuses. A
  plain `./omni graph build` now just works once the venv exists. Verified
  from a system Python without tree-sitter, with no venv available, and with
  a deliberately failing `OMNI_GRAPH_PYTHON`; two new checks added to the
  end-to-end script (60 total).

## 2026-09-18 (2)

### Completed

- `REQ-021` | Code understanding | The code graph can now be listed in full and
  explored in 3D. `omni graph show --all` prints every node grouped by file
  with in/out edge counts (filter with `--kind`, `--language`, `--file`;
  `--edges`, `--sort file|degree|name`, `--limit`, `--json`; external
  placeholders hidden unless `--include-external`). `omni graph view` writes
  `.ai/project-graph.html`, one self-contained offline page (nothing fetched
  at view time) with orbit/pan/zoom, search, language and edge-type filters,
  colouring by language/kind/top-level directory, a detail panel listing each
  symbol's callers and callees (click to jump), and double-click to expand a
  node's neighbours; it starts with the 500 best-connected symbols
  (`--max-initial`, `--all`, or `--focus <symbol> --depth N`). The 3D engine is
  the unmodified 3d-force-graph 1.80.0 bundle (MIT, Copyright (c) Vasco
  Asturiano) which renders with three.js (MIT) and contains 33 other
  permissively licensed packages; `.ai/graph-viewer/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
  is generated from each package's own license file, the same text is
  embedded in every generated page, and `NOTICE` points at it. The vendored
  assets are copied by `adopt --include-cli`/`update`, excluded from
  assistant prompt context via `.ai/.ignore`, and never parsed by `graph
  build`. README also documents the virtualenv route for PEP 668 systems,
  where `pip install` of tree-sitter is refused. Verified by a 56-check
  end-to-end script and a headless-Chromium (software WebGL) run of search,
  select, expand and isolate; a real bug found that way (the library clears
  its host element, wiping the status bar) is fixed. Not verified on touch
  devices or with a hardware GPU.

## 2026-09-18

### Completed

- `REQ-020` | Enforcement | Completion rules are now executed instead of
  merely documented. Rulepack `validation` blocks were never run by any
  code, and `omni doctor` only checked that requirement keys existed, never
  their types -- so an adopter's assistant skipped changelog/registry updates
  at will and hand-wrote 25 schema-violating registry fields that `doctor`
  passed. New: `omni gate` executes `co_changed` rules (changed files must
  be accompanied by a `CHANGELOG.md` and requirements-registry change) over
  the working tree plus every commit since the merge-base with `origin/main`,
  so committing cannot hide a missing update; `omni waive <rule> --reason`
  records an auditable line in `.ai/gate-waivers.jsonl` (only waivers added
  in the current change set count); `omni hook install` wires a Claude Code
  Stop hook (`omni gate --hook`) that exits 2 to block finishing, at most
  once per distinct failing state and never when `stop_hook_active` is set.
  `omni requirement show|list|search|update|complete|archive` replace reading
  and hand-editing the registry JSON (an adopter's had grown to 531 KB and
  the `minimum` context profile told every session to load it); archived
  entries stay queryable and ids are never reused. `doctor` now type- and
  enum-checks the registry and its archive. `classification_banner` and
  `allowed_root_paths` are new `configuration` keys: the banner is rendered
  into every assistant shim and its absence is a `doctor` error (plain
  `sync` used to silently strip a hand-added CUI marking), and doctor no
  longer flags git-ignored root paths or IDE/assistant state directories.
  The Claude entrypoint no longer embeds a duplicate copy of the fallback
  contract. Verified by a 42-check end-to-end script in a throwaway git repo;
  the Stop hook itself was exercised by piping hook JSON, not inside a live
  Claude Code session.

## 2026-09-03 (2)

### Completed

- `REQ-019` | Code understanding | Added `omni graph render`, making the
  node-link graph visualization a permanent CLI feature instead of a
  one-off script. Renders `.ai/project-graph.json` as a force-directed SVG
  using a small pure-Python Fruchterman-Reingold layout -- no numpy/
  networkx dependency, so `render` works with just the standard library,
  same as `trace`/`show` (only `build` needs the `[graph]` extra). Nodes
  colored by language, sized by kind; edges distinguish `calls`/`imports`/
  `inherits` from de-emphasized `defines`. `--max-nodes` caps large graphs
  to the highest-degree nodes to keep the O(n^2) layout fast (~0.2s for 112
  nodes, ~1.3s for 300, measured against this repo); `--focus`/`--depth`
  renders one symbol's neighborhood instead of the whole codebase.
  `design/diagrams/omni-code-graph.svg` was regenerated using this actual
  command, replacing the prior one-off script's output.

## 2026-09-03

### Completed

- `REQ-018` | Presentation / documentation | Replaced
  `design/diagrams/omni-code-map.svg` (a hierarchical org-chart-style
  diagram) with `design/diagrams/omni-code-graph.svg` -- user feedback was
  that the first version didn't read as "a graph." The new version is a
  real force-directed node-link layout (networkx `spring_layout`) over all
  106 real symbols and 277 resolved edges from the same
  `.ai/project-graph.json` `omni graph build` output: circles sized by kind
  and colored by source module, lines distinguishing `calls` from
  `defines`. Same underlying data, correctly graph-shaped this time.

## 2026-09-02 (2)

### Completed

- `REQ-017` | CLI / template maintainability | Fixed two bugs found by
  actually adopting/updating a simulated pre-existing application with the
  new `omni graph` feature in place, instead of trusting the change in
  isolation: (1) `omni adopt --include-cli` copied `make_ai.py` (which
  unconditionally imports `omni_graph`) without copying `omni_graph.py`
  itself, crashing every `omni` command in the adopted project, not just
  `graph` -- fixed by adding `omni_graph.py` to `ADOPTION_CLI_FILES`. (2) A
  project adopted before `omni_graph.py` existed hit the same crash on its
  first `omni update` against a current source, because `omni update`'s
  file list is computed by the *currently running* (old) `make_ai.py`, not
  the newer `--source` -- a structural gap that means a target can never
  discover a brand-new template file on the very first update after it's
  introduced. Made `make_ai.py`'s `import omni_graph` defensive instead
  (falls back to `None`, with a shared guard on every `omni graph`
  subcommand and a doctor warning), so a target still missing
  `omni_graph.py` for any reason degrades to "omni graph is unavailable"
  rather than breaking every other command. Verified end to end: fresh
  adopt, a simulated pre-existing-adoption upgrade (crash gone, clear
  warning, self-heals on the next update), and that adopter customizations
  survive both update passes untouched.

## 2026-09-02

### Completed

- `REQ-016` | Presentation / brand identity | Restyled OmniEngineering's
  brand assets to match the visual family already shared by the two sibling
  projects on this account (context-relay-mcp's CtxRelay, PathBox): dark
  `#0f0f12` ground, single `#e0475c` accent, monospace wordmark, and a
  48x48 panel-plus-corner-nodes-plus-beacon mark under `assets/brand/`.
  Added `assets/brand/omni-{mark,wordmark,banner}.svg` -- same shared chrome
  as the siblings, with OmniEngineering's own mark content: a hub fanned out
  to five nodes, standing for one repo-local `.ai/` control plane synced out
  to many AI assistant entrypoints. Removed the old, unrelated
  `assets/banners/` and `assets/identity/` SVGs. Updated README's banner and
  presentation-assets list, `make_ai.py`'s `ADOPTION_PRESENTATION_FILES`
  (so `omni adopt --include-presentation` still works), and removed a stray
  `assets/brand/` line from `.gitignore` left over from before this became
  the real asset directory, which would have made the new files untrackable.

## 2026-09-01

### Completed

- `REQ-015` | Code understanding | Added `omni graph build/trace/show` and a
  new `omni_graph.py` module: a local, deterministic code graph parsed from
  source with tree-sitter -- explicitly not a vector index, no embeddings.
  Nodes are code entities (module/class/function/method) read straight from
  the syntax tree; edges are tagged `EXTRACTED` (a fact read directly from
  one source site -- an import, a call, a base class) or `INFERRED`
  (resolved by traversing the graph across files/scopes, or by an optional
  configured semantic API pass). `omni graph trace <a> <b>` answers "how are
  these connected" with an actual shortest path of tagged hops; `omni graph
  show <node>` lists a symbol's direct edges. Covers Python, JavaScript, and
  TypeScript. tree-sitter and its grammars ship as an optional `[graph]`
  extra -- `build` fails with an actionable install message if it's missing,
  while `trace`/`show` only read the JSON `build` wrote and need nothing
  beyond the standard library. The semantic pass is opt-in
  (`--semantic` + `OMNI_GRAPH_SEMANTIC_API_URL`) and validates every
  API-suggested relation against known graph symbol names before adding it,
  so a hallucinated relation can't be written in silently. `omni doctor`
  gained a non-blocking check that validates the graph file's shape only
  when one is present. The CLI (subcommand-per-verb, `--json` everywhere) is
  designed to be wrapped 1:1 by an MCP relay the same way `omni_map` /
  `omni_doctor` / `omni_sync` already are.

## 2026-08-27 (4)

### Completed

- `REQ-014` | CLI / template maintainability | Fixed a bug in `omni update`
  (REQ-013) found live while dogfooding it against STEP_App's genuinely
  diverged `make_ai.py`: a conflicted `make_ai.py` merge still triggered the
  automatic sync re-run, crashing with a raw `SyntaxError` traceback against
  the now-invalid file instead of a clean message. `omni update` now skips
  the sync re-run when `make_ai.py` itself has an unresolved conflict and
  tells the user to run `omni sync` themselves once it's fixed.

## 2026-08-27 (3)

### Completed

- `REQ-013` | CLI / template maintainability | Added `omni update` --
  3-way-merges every template-managed file (rulepacks, playbooks, checklists,
  SWEBOK knowledge, schemas, entrypoints, `make_ai.py`/`omni`) into an
  already-adopted, already-customized workspace via `git merge-file`, using
  the ref recorded in the new `.ai/omni-version.json` (written automatically
  by `omni adopt`) as the merge base. Adopter-untouched files that changed
  upstream fast-path update; adopter customizations the template didn't
  touch are left alone; real collisions get `<<<<<<<` conflict markers to
  resolve by hand, same as a git merge. `.ai/project-configuration.md`,
  `.ai/project-map.md`, `.ai/requirements/requirements.json`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` are never touched -- those stay adopter-owned. If
  `make_ai.py` itself changed, `update` re-runs `sync` in a fresh process so
  entrypoint/pointer/ignore files regenerate from the new templates. Added
  `--bootstrap` for workspaces adopted before this existed (records
  `--source`'s current ref as a starting point without merging anything),
  a matching `omni doctor` check that warns when `.ai/omni-version.json` is
  missing, and a README Quick Start section covering the whole
  adopt/doctor/update loop -- this was the single biggest "clunky" gap
  raised this session: pulling template improvements into an adopted
  project previously meant a manual hand-diff-and-port, done twice by hand
  earlier in this same session before this command existed.

## 2026-08-27 (2)

### Completed

- `REQ-012` | CI / repo hygiene | Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running
  `python3 omni doctor` (full-history checkout) on every push/PR to `main`,
  and `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) to stop future line-ending
  drift -- this repo's working tree had silently drifted to CRLF against
  an LF-committed history, masking real diffs behind whole-file noise.
  Existing committed content is untouched; a follow-up renormalization
  commit is intentionally out of scope here since it would touch every
  file in the repo.

## 2026-08-27

### Completed

- `REQ-011` | Doctor / drift detection | Added `validate_project_map_freshness`
  (warns when a top-level directory on disk is missing from
  `.ai/project-map.md`'s tree) and `validate_recent_commits_tracked` (warns
  when commits postdate the last `CHANGELOG.md`-touching commit, by commit
  timestamp rather than `git log X..HEAD` DAG reachability, which
  squash-merge PR histories make misleading) to `omni doctor`. Developed
  while auditing an adopter project (STEP) for OmniEngineering alignment,
  where both gaps were found live -- a stale map missing a whole added
  directory, and several commits merged with no requirement ID or
  changelog entry -- then ported back here so every adopter's `omni doctor`
  catches the same drift automatically.

### Completed

- `REQ-010` | Compatibility | Removed the Python 3.11-only `tomllib`
  dependency from the maintenance CLI, restored Python 3.10 compatibility, and
  kept pyproject console-script validation with a lightweight text check.
- `REQ-009` | CLI ergonomics | Added a repo-local `omni` command shim and
  installable `pyproject.toml` console script so users can run `omni doctor`,
  `omni sync`, and other maintenance commands without typing
  `python3 make_ai.py`.
- `REQ-008` | Authoring interface | Added low-friction CLI commands for
  appending requirements and structured rulepack rules without hand-editing
  large JSON files, documented the workflow, and used the new commands to add
  the requirement and a rulepack authoring recommendation.
- `REQ-007` | Structured rulepacks | Converted enforceable companion rules
  from Markdown to schema-backed JSON rulepacks, added a rulepack schema, and
  updated doctor validation to check rulepack IDs, required keys, rule IDs,
  severities, and statements.
- `REQ-006` | Ruleset refinement | Replaced the Python-specific data rule
  file with bounded, framework-agnostic data governance rules covering data
  boundaries, contracts, validation, transformations, privacy, persistence,
  migrations, and testing.
- `REQ-005` | Documentation clarity | Repositioned OmniContext as a repo-local
  AI control plane for solving context drift across assistants, clarified that
  cloned repositories do not require `make_ai.py` for normal usage, and updated
  the CLI description to present it as maintenance tooling.
- `REQ-004` | Assistant fallback rules | Added shared fallback LLM rules and
  embedded a specific fallback operating contract into Claude, Cursor, and
  Copilot entrypoints so assistants still receive core constraints if they skip
  the primary `.ai/` configuration.

### Completed

- `REQ-003` | Executable validation | Added a dependency-free OmniContext CLI
  with `sync`, `doctor`, and `validate` commands, introduced a requirements
  registry, added schema contracts for requirements and the global ruleset,
  documented the new workflow, and added repository hygiene ignores.
- `REQ-002` | Documentation | Added a polished OmniContext README,
  repository architecture explanation, setup guidance, daily workflow notes, and
  a supporting SVG architecture diagram.
- `REQ-001` | AI workspace ruleset | Added the universal engineering ruleset
  as the controlling global configuration, aligned controlled implementation and
  completion workflow rules to the pasted requirements, added project
  configuration placeholders, refreshed assistant entrypoints, and changed the
  bootstrap script to verify source-of-truth rule files instead of overwriting
  them.
