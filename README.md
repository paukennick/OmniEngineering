OmniEngineering is a repo-local software engineering workspace for human and AI
engineering teams. Its goal is bigger than prompt sharing: it gives a project a
durable way to carry requirements, engineering rules, delivery workflows,
quality gates, design knowledge, and assistant context together.

OmniContext is the context-governance layer inside this workspace. Its job is to
prevent AI context drift when a team uses more than one assistant or model in
the same repository. Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kiro-style
tools, local models, DeepSeek-based workflows, model routers, and future tools
can all read different entry files or prompts, but OmniContext routes them to
one shared `.ai/` source of truth.

The result is one practical engineering operating model: project rules,
architecture guidelines, security boundaries, requirement IDs, validation
expectations, SWEBOK-aligned knowledge, playbooks, checklists, handoff rules,
and completion workflows across every assistant.

![OmniEngineering architecture](assets/omni-context.svg)

## Quick Start

In short: a `.ai/` folder of rules, playbooks, and checklists that every AI
coding assistant in your repo reads from instead of its own separate config
file, plus a small dependency-free CLI (`omni`) to keep it healthy.

**1. Get a checkout of this repo** (you'll adopt *from* it, so keep it around):

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> ../OmniEngineering
```

**2. Add it to your project** (run from inside the `OmniEngineering` checkout):

```bash
cd ../OmniEngineering
./omni adopt --target ../your-project --dry-run       # preview first
./omni adopt --target ../your-project --include-cli    # then actually copy
```

**3. Check it's healthy** (run from inside your project):

```bash
cd ../your-project
./omni doctor
```

**Later, pull in template improvements** (new rulepacks, new `doctor` checks,
etc.) without losing anything you've customized:

```bash
./omni update --source ../OmniEngineering --dry-run   # preview
./omni update --source ../OmniEngineering              # apply
```

`omni update` never touches your `requirements.json`, `project-map.md`,
`project-configuration.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` -- see
[Updating an adopted workspace](#updating-an-adopted-workspace) for exactly
how it decides what's safe to change, and what to do if your project adopted
OmniEngineering before this command existed.

That's the whole loop: adopt once, `doctor` to check health, `update` to stay
current. Everything below explains *why* it's built this way and covers less
common setups (bare `.ai/` copy, symlinks, CI wiring, multi-tool projects).

## Design Documents

The project design source lives in `design/`. It includes product design,
system architecture, data model, assistant workflow, CLI behavior, validation
and operations, decision records, and supporting diagrams.

Start with:

- [Design overview](design/README.md)
- [System architecture](design/system-architecture.md)
- [Context routing diagram](design/diagrams/context-routing.svg)
- [Assistant lifecycle diagram](design/diagrams/assistant-lifecycle.svg)
- [Data model diagram](design/diagrams/data-model.svg)
- [Code graph](design/diagrams/omni-code-graph.svg) -- a real force-directed
  node-link graph of every symbol and resolved call/containment edge in
  this repo, laid out from `omni graph build`'s own output against itself,
  not hand-drawn

## The Problem

Modern software teams rarely use only one AI assistant.

Codex may read `AGENTS.md`, Cursor may read `.cursorrules`, Claude Code may
read `CLAUDE.md`, and GitHub Copilot may read
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`. If each file contains a different version of
the project instructions, assistant behavior drifts.

Local models, hosted chat models, model-router gateways, and model APIs may not
read any repository entrypoint automatically. For those tools, OmniContext
provides `LLM_CONTEXT.md`, `.ai/context-manifest.json`, and copy-paste adapter
prompts in `.ai/adapters/`.

OmniContext solves that drift by making the root assistant files lightweight
routing shims. They point to `.ai/entrypoints/`, which points back to the
shared `.ai/` engineering workspace.

The unique case this solves is not prompt storage. It is governance for
AI-assisted development across multiple tools:

- One assistant should not skip requirement IDs while another uses them.
- One assistant should not update code without the changelog rule another tool
  follows.
- One assistant should not ignore security boundaries because it reads a
  different config file.
- One assistant should not claim completion without the validation workflow the
  rest of the team expects.

OmniEngineering gives the repository a shared engineering operating model
without locking the team into one vendor or editor.

The `.ai/` directory is the master context directory. Root files are thin
compatibility shims for tools that require fixed filenames; the full
tool-specific instructions live in `.ai/entrypoints/`.

| Tool | Required shim | Full source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Universal LLMs | `LLM_CONTEXT.md` | `.ai/entrypoints/universal.md` |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | `.ai/entrypoints/codex.md` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `.ai/entrypoints/claude.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | `.ai/entrypoints/cursor.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.ai/entrypoints/copilot.md` |
| Kiro-style workflows | `.kiro/steering/omnicontext.md` | `.ai/entrypoints/kiro.md` |
| DeepSeek or local model wrappers | none | `.ai/adapters/deepseek.md`, `.ai/adapters/local-model.md` |
| OpenRouter or model gateways | none | `.ai/adapters/openrouter.md`, `.ai/adapters/model-router.md` |

## What This Workspace Enforces

This implementation goes beyond prompt sharing and context drift prevention. It
includes a strict file-based engineering workflow that can be reused across
projects without an MCP server:

- Targeted file access before any implementation work.
- Requirement IDs for every task and code change.
- Planning, implementation, review, testing, debugging, refactoring, migration,
  release, and handoff playbooks.
- Pre-implementation, pre-completion, public release, and security checklists.
- SWEBOK-aligned software requirements, design, construction, testing,
  maintenance, configuration management, engineering management, process,
  models and methods, quality, professional practice, economics, computing
  foundations, mathematical foundations, and engineering foundations guidance
  with quality checklists and lightweight templates.
- Small, isolated changes instead of broad rewrites.
- Modular, maintainable design standards.
- Security guardrails for secrets and sensitive files.
- Documentation and changelog updates as completion gates.
- Test, lint, typecheck, and build validation before claiming completion.
- Required final reporting with commit and pull request information.
- A requirement registry for tracking `REQ-###` work across assistants.
- A dependency-free doctor command for detecting workspace drift.
- A centralized fallback contract in `.ai/entrypoints/fallback-contract.md` in
  case an LLM skips the primary `.ai/` configuration.

The controlling global ruleset is:

```text
.ai/rules/universal-engineering-ruleset.json
```

Enforceable companion rules live beside it as structured JSON rulepacks in
`.ai/rules/`. The JSON format gives each rule a stable ID, severity, scope, and
validation hints so tools can inspect more than file existence.

## Context And Model Discipline

OmniEngineering is designed to reduce token waste and context drift.

- **Load the brief first:** `.ai/context-brief.md` is the low-token starting
  layer. It tells assistants which small profile to load for the current task
  instead of reading every rule, playbook, checklist, and knowledge pack.
- **Use context profiles:** `.ai/context-manifest.json` defines minimum,
  implementation, review, and deep-policy loading profiles. Start with the
  smallest profile and escalate only when the task needs it.
- **Control the context window:** Keep `.ai/.ignore`, `.cursorignore`,
  `.gitignore`, and equivalent tool ignore files aggressive. Exclude logs,
  compiled artifacts, local environment files, dependency folders, generated
  output, caches, and large binaries.
- **Use the generated project map:** Run `./omni map` after adopting the
  workspace or changing project structure. Assistants should read
  `.ai/project-map.md` before broad traversal, then inspect only the smallest
  relevant path set.
- **Attach context manually:** Prefer attaching or naming the exact files and
  folders needed for the current requirement instead of allowing automatic
  whole-workspace scans.
- **Reset stale history:** Start a new session or compact the current one when
  switching tasks so old conversation history does not consume tokens or steer
  unrelated work.
- **Prompt specifically:** Include the requirement ID, framework, language,
  relevant patterns, constraints, and desired outcome in the first prompt when
  known.
- **Ask for outlines first:** For broad or risky work, ask for a plan or
  pseudo-code outline before generating or applying a large patch.
- **Cascade models:** Use cheaper or lower-effort models for boilerplate,
  formatting, simple docs, and mechanical edits. Save flagship or high-effort
  models for architecture, complex debugging, migrations, security-sensitive
  work, and high-risk design decisions.

The goal is not to make every prompt larger. The default path should be:

```text
context brief -> project map -> active requirement -> one relevant playbook/checklist -> target files
```

Load full rulepacks, SWEBOK knowledge packs, templates, and design docs only
when the task specifically needs that depth.

## If You Clone a Repo That Already Uses This Workspace

You do not need to run `make_ai.py` just to benefit from the workspace.

If the repository already contains `.ai/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `LLM_CONTEXT.md`, and
`.ai/context-manifest.json`, the workspace is already usable. Open the repo in
your assistant of choice and the shim files should route that assistant to the
matching source file in `.ai/entrypoints/`.

For a local model, DeepSeek chat/API wrapper, OpenRouter-style model gateway, or
any tool that does not read repository files automatically, paste the relevant
prompt from `.ai/adapters/` into the model's system, developer, or project
instruction field.

For model routers, include the adapter prompt in each new routed session. The
router can switch model slugs or providers, so context should be treated as part
of the request payload.

Use `make_ai.py` or `./omni` when you want to verify, sync, or adapt the
engineering workspace inside that repository:

- Run `./omni doctor` to check whether the workspace is healthy.
- Run `./omni sync` after editing entrypoint routing, fallback behavior, or
  assistant source content.
- Run `./omni validate` as an alias for `doctor`.

In other words: `.ai/` is the delivery workspace. `make_ai.py` and `omni` are
maintenance tools for checking and synchronizing it.

## Add The Workspace To A Project

Do not recreate the directory tree by hand. Bring the workspace files into the
target repository, then configure them for that project.

Use one of these adoption paths:

| Path | Best For | What To Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Template copy | New repositories | Create the project from an OmniEngineering template or copy this repository, then replace project-specific placeholders. |
| Drop-in copy | Existing repositories | Copy `.ai/` and only the needed tool shims into the target repo root, review conflicts, then run `./omni doctor`. |
| Vendored source | Teams that want upstream updates | Add OmniEngineering as a tracked subtree, submodule, or vendor directory, then copy or safely sync the root shims into the project. |
| Internal baseline | Organizations | Keep an approved internal fork and periodically merge upstream OmniEngineering improvements. |

For a normal existing repository, copy `.ai/` into the target repo root first:

```text
.ai/
```

Then add only the shims for tools the team actually uses:

```text
LLM_CONTEXT.md
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
.cursorrules
.cursorignore
.github/copilot-instructions.md
.kiro/steering/omnicontext.md
```

Add the maintenance CLI if the project wants local validation and map commands:

```text
omni
make_ai.py
```

Do not overwrite an existing `pyproject.toml`. The installable `omni` console
script is optional; the repo-local `./omni` command is enough for validation.

If the target already has `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`,
`.cursorignore`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.kiro/`, `omni`, or
`make_ai.py`, merge manually instead of replacing the file. `./omni sync` will
skip existing non-Omni files by default. Use `./omni sync --force` only when
replacement is intentional.

You can generate a safe adoption plan before copying:

```bash
./omni adopt --target ../target-project --dry-run
./omni adopt --target ../target-project --tools codex,cursor,universal --include-cli
```

`adopt` copies `.ai/` and selected shims, skips existing target files by
default, and requires `--force` before replacing anything. A successful
(non-dry-run) adoption also writes `.ai/omni-version.json`, recording the
source path and git commit adopted from -- this is what `omni update` (below)
diffs against later.

### Updating an adopted workspace

Once a project has adopted OmniEngineering and customized its rules,
playbooks, or checklists, pulling in later template improvements is a single
command rather than a manual re-copy:

```bash
./omni update --source ../OmniEngineering --dry-run
./omni update --source ../OmniEngineering
```

`update` 3-way-merges every template-managed file (rulepacks, playbooks,
checklists, SWEBOK knowledge, schemas, entrypoints, `make_ai.py`/`omni`)
using `git merge-file` against the ref recorded in `.ai/omni-version.json`:

- Untouched-by-you files that changed upstream are updated automatically.
- Files you customized that the template didn't touch are left alone.
- Files both sides changed are merged; a genuine conflict is left with
  `<<<<<<<`/`>>>>>>>` markers for you to resolve by hand, same as a git merge.
- `.ai/project-configuration.md`, `.ai/project-map.md`,
  `.ai/requirements/requirements.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md` are never touched
  -- those are yours, not the template's.

`--source` must point to a git checkout of OmniEngineering (not a plain
folder copy) since reconstructing the merge base requires its commit
history. Pass `--include-legal` or `--include-presentation` to also merge
those optional bundles.

**Already adopted OmniEngineering before `omni update` existed?** There's no
`.ai/omni-version.json` yet, so a plain `omni update` will refuse (it has
nothing to compare against). Fix that once, from the adopted project:

```bash
./omni update --source ../OmniEngineering --bootstrap
```

This merges nothing -- it just records today as the starting point. Every
`omni update` after that works normally.

Optional presentation assets:

```text
assets/brand/
assets/omni-context.svg
design/
```

Keep the OmniEngineering license files when you distribute copied or modified
OmniEngineering workspace files:

```text
LICENSE
NOTICE
TRADEMARKS.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSES/
```

Then add or keep the target project's own license for its application code,
product code, docs, and data.

After copying, run:

```bash
./omni doctor
./omni map
```

If you edited fallback text or assistant entrypoints while adapting the
workspace, run:

```bash
./omni sync
./omni map
./omni doctor
```

`./omni sync` is collision-safe by default: it skips existing non-Omni files
instead of overwriting project-owned assistant configuration. Use
`./omni sync --force` only when replacement is intentional.

The root assistant files are already written as shims for Codex, Claude Code,
Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kiro-style workflows, and generic/local/model-router
workflows. Edit `.ai/entrypoints/` for tool-specific behavior, then run
`./omni sync`.

## Configure a Project

Before using the workspace on a real project, fill in:

```text
.ai/project-configuration.md
```

At minimum, define:

- Project name.
- Repository type.
- Primary language or stack.
- Package manager.
- Build command.
- Test command.
- Lint command.
- Typecheck command.
- Changelog location.
- Documentation locations.
- Branching or pull request standard.
- Comment style.

Then customize:

```text
.ai/rules/universal-engineering-ruleset.json
```

Replace the angle-bracket placeholders with project-specific values and add
project requirements using the included `REQ-###` template.

## Daily Use

Once the workspace is initialized, keep the root assistant files boring. Most
changes should happen inside `.ai/`.

| Need | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| Low-token loading contract | `.ai/context-brief.md` |
| Global assistant behavior | `.ai/core-context.md` |
| Project commands and placeholders | `.ai/project-configuration.md` |
| Portable model loading order | `.ai/context-manifest.json` |
| Generated project structure map | `.ai/project-map.md` |
| Tool-specific entrypoint sources | `.ai/entrypoints/` |
| Local, DeepSeek, or generic model prompts | `.ai/adapters/` |
| OpenRouter or model-gateway prompts | `.ai/adapters/openrouter.md`, `.ai/adapters/model-router.md` |
| Task execution guidance | `.ai/playbooks/` |
| Completion gates | `.ai/checklists/` |
| Body-of-knowledge guidance | `.ai/knowledge/` |
| Strict operating rules | `.ai/rules/universal-engineering-ruleset.json` |
| Requirement registry | `.ai/requirements/requirements.json` |
| Machine-readable contracts | `.ai/schemas/` |
| Implementation workflow | `.ai/rules/controlled-implementation.json` |
| Completion and reporting workflow | `.ai/rules/completion-workflow.json` |
| Data contracts and transformations | `.ai/rules/data-governance.json` |
| Fallback assistant behavior | `.ai/entrypoints/fallback-contract.md`, `.ai/rules/fallback-llm-rules.json` |
| Security exclusions | `.ai/.ignore` |
| Change history | `CHANGELOG.md` |

Example prompt:

```text
Implement REQ-014. Use the minimum access scope from the requirement and follow
the completion workflow in .ai/rules/completion-workflow.json.
```

## Maintenance CLI

`omni` is a small dependency-free maintenance helper. It is not required for
normal day-to-day AI usage after the files are already present in a repo, but it
is the easiest way to confirm a drop-in copy is healthy. It requires Python 3.10
or newer.

Use it when you first bring the workspace into a project, change engineering
workspace configuration, edit assistant entrypoints, add rulepacks, or prepare a
public release.

Run it directly from the repository:

```bash
./omni doctor
./omni sync
./omni map
./omni context implementation
```

`./omni sync` updates generated Omni files and skips existing non-Omni files.
Use `./omni sync --force` only after manually deciding replacement is safe.

`./omni context <profile>` prints the exact low-token file set for a task.
Useful profiles are `minimum`, `implementation`, `review`, and `deep_policy`.

Or install the command once from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

After that, use:

```bash
omni doctor
omni sync
omni validate
omni map
omni context review
```

`sync` verifies that the required `.ai/` source-of-truth files exist, then
refreshes `.ai/entrypoints/`, the root shim files, and synced ignore files.

It does not overwrite the `.ai/` rules. The rules are the source of truth.

`map` generates `.ai/project-map.md`, a compact structure map of the adopter's
project repository. It is meant for LLM navigation: read the map first, choose a
small relevant path set, then inspect only those files. The generated map does
not include file contents and filters paths listed in `.ai/.ignore` plus common
dependency, build, cache, VCS, and local-session directories.

Regenerate it after substantial file moves or new top-level modules:

```bash
omni map
```

Run the doctor after copying, publishing, or adapting the workspace:

```bash
omni doctor
```

The doctor checks:

- Required `.ai/` source-of-truth files.
- JSON parse validity.
- Universal ruleset structure.
- Structured rulepack IDs, required keys, rule IDs, severities, and statements.
- Requirement registry structure and duplicate IDs.
- Assistant pointer drift.
- Assistant entrypoint source drift.
- Synced ignore file drift.
- Workspace file placement.
- Fallback rule availability.
- License, notice, and trademark policy presence.
- Registered MCP servers: every stdio server in `.mcp.json` is launched for real,
  taken through `initialize` and `tools/list`, and must answer with at least one
  tool (a registration that no longer starts would otherwise fail silently).
- Generated project map availability.
- README architecture references.
- Changelog presence.

`validate` is an alias for `doctor`:

```bash
omni validate
```

## Code Graph (omni graph)

`omni map` tells an assistant where files live. `omni graph` tells it how the
code inside those files actually connects -- which function calls which,
which class inherits from which, which module imports which -- as a real,
traversable graph, not a vector index. There are no embeddings and no
similarity scores: every node is a code entity read straight out of a
tree-sitter syntax tree, and every edge is tagged with exactly where it came
from:

- **EXTRACTED** -- a fact read directly from one source site: this import
  statement names this module; this call site names this function; this
  class statement names this base class. Nothing was resolved.
- **INFERRED** -- resolved by traversing the graph itself (following imports
  and scopes across files to find the actual definition a name refers to),
  or, if you configure a semantic API, by that API. An INFERRED edge always
  sits on top of an EXTRACTED edge that justifies it; an unresolved
  reference is left EXTRACTED-only rather than guessed.

Build the graph (covers Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript):

```bash
omni graph build
```

This needs tree-sitter and its per-language grammars, which are an optional
extra so the workspace stays dependency-free by default. If you cloned this
repo (its `pyproject.toml` is present):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[graph]"
```

If you adopted `omni`/`make_ai.py`/`omni_graph.py` into another project via
`omni adopt --include-cli` (no `pyproject.toml` from this repo there), install
the same packages directly instead:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "tree-sitter>=0.23,<1.0" "tree-sitter-python>=0.23,<1.0" \
  "tree-sitter-javascript>=0.23,<1.0" "tree-sitter-typescript>=0.23,<1.0"
```

On Debian/Ubuntu (and other PEP 668 "externally managed" Pythons) `pip`
refuses system-wide installs. Use a virtualenv and run `build` with its
interpreter, rather than `--break-system-packages`:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/omni-graph
~/.venvs/omni-graph/bin/pip install "tree-sitter>=0.23,<1.0" "tree-sitter-python>=0.23,<1.0" \
  "tree-sitter-javascript>=0.23,<1.0" "tree-sitter-typescript>=0.23,<1.0"
~/.venvs/omni-graph/bin/python ./omni graph build
```

You do not have to remember the long form: if `omni graph build` finds tree-sitter
missing, it re-runs itself under `~/.venvs/omni-graph/bin/python` (or the
interpreter named by `OMNI_GRAPH_PYTHON`) when that venv has the packages, so a
plain `./omni graph build` works. If no such venv exists it prints the setup
commands above instead of a `pip install` that would be refused.

Without either, `omni graph build` fails with a clear install message
instead of a traceback. `trace` and `show` below only read the JSON `build`
already wrote, so they work with just the standard library.

Ask how two symbols are connected -- this is the point of the feature. A
plain name resolves if it's unique; use `Class::method` or the full
`file::path` id to disambiguate, the same identifiers the graph's own JSON
uses:

```bash
omni graph trace run_doctor "DoctorReport::error"
```

```
make_ai.py::run_doctor
  --[calls, INFERRED]--> make_ai.py::DoctorReport
  --[defines, EXTRACTED]--> make_ai.py::DoctorReport::error
```

Inspect one symbol's direct connections:

```bash
omni graph show "make_ai.py::DoctorReport"
```

See the whole thing as an actual graph -- a force-directed node-link SVG,
not a chart -- rendered by a small pure-Python layout (no numpy/networkx;
`render`, like `trace`/`show`, only needs the standard library):

```bash
omni graph render
```

This writes `.ai/project-graph.svg`: circles are symbols (sized by
module/class/function, colored by language), lines are resolved edges
(`calls`/`imports`/`inherits` in color, `defines` faint). It updates every
time you run it, so it always reflects the current state of your project --
regenerate it after significant changes the same way you'd re-run `omni
map`. Large graphs are capped to the highest-degree `--max-nodes` (default
300); use `--focus <symbol> --depth 2` to render just one area's
neighborhood instead of the whole codebase, and `--include-external` to
also show unresolved references (stdlib calls, third-party imports).

List everything the graph knows, not just one symbol:

```bash
omni graph show --all                       # every symbol, grouped by file, with in/out edge counts
omni graph show --all --kind class --sort degree --limit 20
omni graph show --all --file 'frontend/*' --language typescript
omni graph show --all --edges --include-external   # also print edges and unresolved references
```

Explore it interactively in 3D -- rotate, pan, zoom, click a node to read
it, double-click to pull its neighbours into the view:

```bash
omni graph view --open
```

This writes `.ai/project-graph.html`, one self-contained file (about 1.5 MB
plus your graph) that works offline: nothing is fetched at view time. It
starts with the 500 best-connected symbols (`--max-initial`, or `--all`,
or `--focus <symbol> --depth 2` for one neighbourhood) and grows as you
expand. The page has search (`/`), language and edge-type filters, colouring
by language, kind or top-level directory, an INFERRED-edge toggle, an
edge-strength slider, and a detail panel that lists each symbol's callers and callees -- click any of
them to jump there. Nodes and edges are scaled by distance so outliers far from the core cluster
and far-away edges stay readable; the styling follows the OmniEngineering brand
(`#e0475c` on `#0f0f12`). It needs a WebGL-capable browser; the SVG from `omni
graph render` and `show --all` remain for everything else. The output is
git-ignored like the JSON and SVG.

Under WSL, `omni graph view` prints the `file:///C:/...` URL (and the plain Windows
path) that a Windows browser can open, not the Linux `/mnt/c/...` path it cannot,
and `--open` launches your default Windows browser through `cmd.exe`.

The 3D engine is the unmodified [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph)
bundle (MIT, (c) Vasco Asturiano), which renders with [three.js](https://threejs.org)
(MIT) and contains 33 other permissively licensed packages. Their notices
live in `.ai/graph-viewer/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and are embedded in every
generated page. The assets in `.ai/graph-viewer/` are excluded from
`.ai/.ignore` so assistants do not read the 1.3 MB minified bundle.

Both `trace`/`show`/`render` for machine-readable output
(render's is a summary, not the SVG itself), and every `omni graph`
subcommand is a thin, scriptable wrapper (one verb in, one JSON document
out) so it can be exposed 1:1 as tools by an MCP relay, the same way
`omni_map` / `omni_doctor` / `omni_sync` already are.

Add `--semantic` to `build` to also run an opt-in enrichment pass tagged
`INFERRED` via a configured API. Nothing leaves this machine unless you set:

```bash
export OMNI_GRAPH_SEMANTIC_API_URL=https://your-endpoint
export OMNI_GRAPH_SEMANTIC_API_KEY=...   # optional
export OMNI_GRAPH_SEMANTIC_MODEL=...     # optional
omni graph build --semantic
```

Every relation the API suggests is checked against known graph symbol names
before being added as an edge, so a hallucinated relation can't be written
into the graph silently.

### Five layers: code, governance, history, assurance, workspace

`omni graph build` builds five layers in one graph, each with its own nodes and
edge types, so a single traversal can go from a line of code to why it exists,
when it changed, how it is proven, and which rule stops it breaking again. This
is what keeps long histories manageable: instead of rereading a changelog or a
git log, ask the graph what is tied to the thing you are about to touch.

| Layer | Nodes | Edges | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **code** | modules, classes, functions, tables | `calls`, `imports`, `defines`, `inherits`, ... | your source (tree-sitter, SQL migrations) |
| **governance** | `requirement`, `changelog` | `touches`, `records`, `mentions` | requirement files, changelog |
| **history** | `commit` | `delivers`, `modifies`, `logged_in`, `follows` | the git log |
| **assurance** | test files, `suite`, `failure` | `verifies`, `contains`, `covers`, `affects`, `arose_in`, `guards`, `fixed_by`, `recurs` | tests, the suite registry, the failure ledger |
| **workspace** | `rulepack`, `rule`, `playbook`, `checklist`, and OmniEngineering's own code | `defines`, `prevented_by` | `.ai/rules`, `.ai/playbooks`, `.ai/checklists`, `make_ai.py`, `omni_graph.py` |

- A requirement `touches` the files in its declared scope (EXTRACTED) and the
  files changed by commits that deliver it (INFERRED). Changelog entries `record`
  the requirements they name and `mention` the files they cite.
- Every commit is a node, chained in order (`follows`). A commit `delivers` the
  requirement named in its subject line (a body that cites another project's id is
  ignored), `modifies` the files it changed, and is `logged_in` the changelog entry
  whose heading it added. A squash commit with no id in its message is tied to the
  requirement its changelog entry records (INFERRED).
- The assurance layer is about **your project's tests**. Test files (`test_*.py`,
  `*.test.ts`, `*Test.java`, `tests/`, ...) and anything a registered suite claims
  move to it, and `verifies` edges connect each test file to the code it calls.
  OmniEngineering's own files are tooling: they sit in the workspace layer and are
  never counted as tests, suites, or coverage. A suite groups its test files, says
  how to run them, and `covers` the code it is meant to cover.
- The failure ledger adds a `failure` node per entry with its symptom and root
  cause, linked to the code it affected, the requirement, the tests or suite that
  `guard` it, the rule or playbook that prevents a repeat (`prevented_by`, into the
  workspace layer), and any earlier failure it repeats.

Traverse across the layers:

```bash
omni graph why omni_graph.py        # requirements, changelog, commits, tests, suites, failures, rules
omni graph why REQ-021              # files touched, changelog entries, commits, failures
omni graph why FAIL-003             # affected code, regression tests, prevention, fix commits
omni graph why a1b2c3d              # a commit: requirements, changelog entry, files, previous/next commit
omni graph why backend-junit        # a suite: its test files, what it covers
omni graph lineage REQ-021          # everything upstream and downstream of it, no second endpoint needed
omni graph lineage a1b2c3d --up     # a commit: the requirement and previous commit that led to it
omni graph lineage FAIL-003 --depth 3 --json   # a failure: cause above it, tests, rules and fixes below it
omni graph timeline REQ-021         # everything dated that is tied to it, oldest first
omni graph show --all --layer history --kind commit
omni graph build --layers code,governance      # skip layers; --max-commits N bounds the git scan
```

Measure the token-savings claim instead of just asserting it, on your own project's own graph, right now:

```bash
omni graph benchmark          # a targeted query vs. grep-and-read-whole (git show for a commit), for real
omni graph benchmark --json
```

For one real requirement, commit, failure and file this project's own graph already has (never invented,
never hardcoded to a specific project), it runs the graph query and the naive alternative -- a plain-text
grep for the name, then every matching file read in full; a commit compares against `git show`, the diff a
person would actually read -- and reports both sizes. "Tokens" are `chars / 4`, a labelled rough estimate,
not a real tokenizer. Two safeguards keep the file case honest: it only ever picks an already-parsed
source module (never a generic file node, so a `.pptx` or an image can't win) and only a git-tracked one
(so a gitignored multi-hundred-megabyte build log that merely happens to have a graph node can't either --
both were real results the first time this ran).

### The viewer

`omni graph view` writes one self-contained, offline HTML page (nothing is fetched when it opens).

- **2D or 3D, one big switch.** The 2D view is a flat Canvas 2D drawing you pan (drag) and zoom
  (scroll or pinch); it never tilts and needs no WebGL or video memory, so it suits low-power
  machines. It is the default. The 3D view orbits in space and needs WebGL; it is created only when
  chosen and destroyed when you switch back, so 2D never holds a GPU context. `--mode 2d|3d|auto`
  sets the start (`auto` remembers your last choice).
- **Views, not layer switches.** Tabs across the top (Everything, Code, Requirements, History, Tests &
  failures, Rules & playbooks, Database) each set the layers, colours and layout for one purpose. A strip
  under them names the current view in large type, explains it in a sentence, and shows a colour key
  with counts for what is on screen. Each layer has one strong hue; kinds also have distinct shapes in 2D
  (diamond requirement, triangle commit, hexagon failure or table, page change-log entry or playbook).
- **2D layouts.** *Network* (connected things sit together), *Layers* (one labelled band per layer, parents
  kept beside their children, so links between layers stay short), and *Tree* (files, classes and methods
  as a tree, parent to child; everything without a parent is listed below, grouped by kind).
- **Select a node and its whole chain lights up.** Everything above it (parents) and below it (children)
  is drawn in gold with bold links, the rest recedes, and the view zooms to that chain. The detail panel
  shows a breadcrumb (`file > class > method`) and buttons that bring in what it connects to, grouped by
  layer. A node with no parent or child highlights what it connects to instead.
- **Trace a path between any two things.** Set a From and a To (in the *Trace a path* menu, from search
  results, or with *Trace from here / to here*) and the shortest chain of links is drawn in pink, every
  node on it labelled, with the steps written out.
- **Search.** Every word must match; `kind:commit`, `layer:assurance`, `lang:java` and `file:...`
  narrow it; results show kind, date and summary, and go to / trace from / trace to buttons; arrow keys and
  Enter work; a miss suggests the closest things. With nothing typed, a kind lists everything of that kind.
- **Comfort.** Every menu section collapses (remembered), every option has a tooltip, filter groups have
  All / None, and there is a soft-grey light theme (not pure white) as well as the dark one.

`omni graph render` draws the code layer only unless you pass `--all-layers`.

### Using it in your own project

Nothing is hard-wired to OmniEngineering's layout. Ask what the build would read
from your project, and what it is missing:

```bash
omni graph sources             # per layer: files found, counts, what is missing, how to fix it
omni graph sources --write     # draft .ai/graph-config.json from what it found
```

Only the settings that differ from the defaults belong in `.ai/graph-config.json`:

| Key | Default | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requirements_files` | `.ai/requirements/requirements*.json` | your requirements or issues live elsewhere (a JSON list, or an object with `requirements`, of `{id/key, title/summary, status, scope/files}`) |
| `requirement_id_pattern` | derived from your ids | your ids are unusual (`#42`); by default the exact ids in your registry are matched, so `PROJ-12`, `FEAT_7` and `REQ-001` all work |
| `changelog_files` | `CHANGELOG.md`, `HISTORY.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, ... | your changelog is named or placed differently (dated `## 2026-01-31`, versioned `## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-31` and `## v1.2.0 (2026-01-31)` headings all work) |
| `test_globs` / `exclude_test_globs` | naming conventions | your tests do not follow them |
| `test_suites_file`, `failure_ledger` | `.ai/test-suites.json`, `.ai/failures/failure-ledger.json` | you keep them elsewhere |
| `ci_files` | GitHub, GitLab, Cloud Build, Azure, Jenkins, Makefile | extra CI files hold your test commands |
| `rules_dir`, `playbook_dirs`, `checklist_dirs` | `.ai/...` | your rules and playbooks live elsewhere |
| `max_commits` | 400 | you want more or less history |
| `tooling_paths` | `make_ai.py`, `omni_graph.py`, `omni`, `.ai/*` | set to `[]` if OmniEngineering itself is your project |

A project with no `.ai/`, no git, no requirements, or no tests still builds: each
missing source becomes a note that says what was looked for and how to point at it.
Malformed JSON is reported by file and line instead of silently ignored, and `omni
doctor` validates the config. The suite registry is managed with `omni test`:

```bash
omni test detect [--write]   # find suites from file contents and CI commands; register them
omni test add --name "Backend JUnit" --paths backend/src/test --framework junit --command "cd backend && mvn test" --covers backend/src/main
omni test list | check | remove <id>
```

### MCP server: the graph as tools for any assistant

`omni graph why/lineage/trace/...` and `omni requirement/failure show/list/search`
already print plain JSON (`--json`). `omni mcp serve` exposes the same data as MCP
(Model Context Protocol) tools over stdio, so an assistant queries this project's
requirements, changelog, commits, tests and failures directly, without a shell tool
to run the CLI and parse its output -- and without that assistant being Claude. This
is the multi-LLM half of "context management": the graph is one project fact base,
reachable by whatever is asking.

```bash
omni mcp tools          # list the tools without starting the server
omni mcp tools --json   # ...with full input schemas, e.g. to feed a client's config
omni mcp serve          # serve them over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0, one JSON object per line) until stdin closes
```

Point an MCP client's command at `omni mcp serve` (working directory: your project
root). Every tool is read-only -- `graph_lineage`, `graph_why`, `graph_trace`,
`graph_timeline`, `graph_show`, `graph_sources`, `requirement_show`,
`requirement_list`, `requirement_search`, `failure_show`, `gate_status` -- so a
client can call them with no confirmation step; nothing here writes a requirement,
a changelog entry or a waiver. `omni requirement draft`, `omni requirement add` and
`omni gate --hook` remain how anything gets written. Hand-rolled against the wire
protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0, stdlib only) rather than an SDK dependency, in keeping with
everything else here: this has to work with only the standard library, on whatever
Python an assistant's environment already has.

## Failure Ledger

Errors are only useful if they are not made twice. The failure ledger
(`.ai/failures/failure-ledger.json`, schema `.ai/schemas/failure-ledger.schema.json`)
records what went wrong, why, the test that now catches it, and the rule or
playbook that prevents a repeat. Manage it with the CLI, not by hand:

```bash
omni failure add --requirement REQ-042 --title "Rounding drops cents" \
  --symptom "total is 10.00, expected 10.05"
omni failure update FAIL-001 --status fixed \
  --root-cause "float used for money" --fix "use Decimal" \
  --tests tests/test_totals.py::test_keeps_cents \
  --affected src/totals.py --prevention-rules money.no_floats
omni failure list --status open
omni failure search "rounding"
omni failure check       # complete, and every file/test/rule it names exists
```

`omni doctor` fails a `fixed` entry that lacks a root cause, a fix, a regression
test (or an honest `no_test_reason`), or a prevention. `omni requirement complete`
refuses a defect/bug/fix/regression requirement that has no ledger entry unless
`--no-failure-entry "<reason>"` is given (the reason is recorded as a risk note).
The rules `completion.failure_ledger`, `completion.regression_test`,
`completion.failure_becomes_rule` and `controlled.consult_failure_history`, and
steps in the debugging, testing, implementation, review, planning, handoff and
release playbooks, make consulting and recording failures part of the standard
workflow. `omni adopt` ships an empty ledger, an empty suite registry and no graph config,
never this repository's own.

## Low-Friction Editing

Most people should not need to hand-edit large JSON files for routine updates.
Use the CLI for small, safe additions.

Add a requirement:

```bash
omni requirement add \
  --title "Add release checklist" \
  --description "Create a repeatable release checklist for AI-assisted changes." \
  --category "Workflow" \
  --priority medium \
  --scope "README.md,.ai/rules/completion-workflow.json" \
  --acceptance "Checklist exists,Doctor passes"
```

If `--id` is omitted, the CLI assigns the next `REQ-###` ID.

Writing that by hand for every commit is exactly the manual overhead this workspace exists to cut down
on. Draft it instead, then edit the draft rather than starting from nothing:

```bash
omni requirement draft                 # from the current (uncommitted) change set
omni requirement draft --commit HEAD   # from one already-made commit: its subject becomes the title
```

The category is guessed from the changed paths (tests, `.github/workflows`, all-Markdown, "fix" in a
path, or a plain default), the scope is the changed files, and the requirement is always written with
status `proposed` -- never `completed` -- so nothing is trusted until a person reviews it. A matching
`### Proposed` stub is appended to `CHANGELOG.md` under today's date. If the commit's message already
cites a requirement ID, nothing is drafted (a duplicate would just be noise); `--force` overrides that.

Query and update the registry without opening the file (it grows large):

```bash
omni requirement list --status pending
omni requirement show REQ-042
omni requirement search "login"
omni requirement update REQ-042 --status blocked --note "waiting on API key"
omni requirement complete REQ-042
omni requirement update REQ-043 --status withdrawn --note "superseded by REQ-050"
omni requirement archive --keep-recent 25   # move old completed and all withdrawn entries aside
omni requirement archive --id REQ-041,REQ-043  # or name them; live (pending, blocked) work is refused
```

Enforce the completion rulepack instead of trusting the assistant to remember it:

```bash
omni gate            # fail if changed files lack changelog/registry updates
omni waive completion.changelog_gate --reason "docs-only typo fix"
omni hook install         # Claude Code Stop hook: blocks the assistant from finishing while the gate fails
omni hook install-git     # portable git pre-commit hook: blocks `git commit` too, any assistant, no assistant, any OS
omni hook install-git --with-graph-rebuild   # ...and rebuild the graph in the background after every commit
```

Most of the 60-odd rules across the rulepacks are judgment calls -- "reduce
cognitive load," "prefer composition," "use clear names" -- and stay that way
on purpose: mechanizing them would mean checking a shallow proxy and letting
the real judgment slide, which is worse than an honest "not machine-checked."
A rule earns a `validation` block only when there is a real, non-fake check
for it. Three types exist today:

| `validation.type` | What it actually checks |
| --- | --- |
| `co_changed` | When any changed path matches `when_changed` (and not `ignore`), at least one changed path must also match `must_also_change` -- e.g. touching anything requires touching `CHANGELOG.md`. |
| `requirement_registry_entry` | Every `REQ-###`-shaped ID cited in a commit message since the base, or newly added to `CHANGELOG.md`, must actually exist in the requirements registry -- catches a typo'd or invented ID that `omni doctor`'s registry-schema check cannot see, since that only validates the registry's own shape, never what other files claim about it. |
| `content_forbidden` | Changed files are scanned for a short list of regex patterns (a private-key header, an AWS-shaped access key, an obviously hardcoded credential). A bounded, honest safety net for the most common accidental leaks, not a claim of exhaustive secret scanning. |

Add a rule to a rulepack:

```bash
omni rule add \
  --rulepack completion \
  --name release_checklist \
  --statement "Use the release checklist before publishing a completed change." \
  --severity recommended \
  --scope "release,completion"
```

Rulepack aliases:

| Alias | Rulepack |
| --- | --- |
| `controlled` | `.ai/rules/controlled-implementation.json` |
| `completion` | `.ai/rules/completion-workflow.json` |
| `data` | `.ai/rules/data-governance.json` |
| `fallback` | `.ai/rules/fallback-llm-rules.json` |
| `hci` or `ui` | `.ai/rules/hci-ui-rules.json` |
| `oop` | `.ai/rules/oop-design.json` |

After edits, run:

```bash
omni doctor
```

## Fallback Rules for LLMs

The root assistant files stay tiny and point to `.ai/entrypoints/`. The compact
fallback operating contract lives in one central file so it does not bloat every
root shim. This protects the workspace when an LLM does not fully follow the
original configuration instruction.

The fallback contract tells every assistant to:

- Confirm or assign a `REQ-###` ID before work begins.
- State the minimum access scope before inspecting files.
- Avoid unrelated repository scans and unrelated file changes.
- Respect `.ai/.ignore` and avoid secrets, credentials, logs, caches, and local
  environment files.
- Preserve existing behavior unless it conflicts with the active requirement.
- Avoid new dependencies, schema changes, destructive data changes, and public
  interface changes unless explicitly required.
- Update docs, changelog, and requirements when work changes behavior or status.
- Run `omni doctor` for workspace changes.
- Run `omni sync` when assistant entrypoint files change.
- Report validation, risks, commit sentence, and pull request information.

The shared source for this behavior is:

```text
.ai/entrypoints/fallback-contract.md
.ai/rules/fallback-llm-rules.json
```

## Security Guardrails

Use `.ai/.ignore` to document files and paths the assistant must not read.
Common examples include:

```text
.env
.env.*
*.pem
*.key
node_modules/
vendor/
.venv/
dist/
build/
*.log
*.sqlite
*.db
```

This is a prompt-level guardrail, not a substitute for repository permissions,
secret scanning, or platform security controls.

## Symlink Alternative

For Unix-only teams, symlinks can route assistant files directly to shared
context. This is an advanced alternative for teams that understand symlink
behavior across their editors and hosting platform:

```bash
ln -s .ai/entrypoints/codex.md AGENTS.md
ln -s .ai/entrypoints/cursor.md .cursorrules
ln -s .ai/entrypoints/claude.md CLAUDE.md
mkdir -p .github
ln -s ../.ai/entrypoints/copilot.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Markdown routing is the default recommendation. A drop-in copy with generated
entrypoint files works better across macOS, Linux, Windows, GitHub, package
archives, and editor integrations.

## Why It Works

OmniEngineering treats AI-assisted delivery as engineering architecture, not
scattered editor settings. Every assistant receives the same project context,
but each tool still gets its native entrypoint.

The result is a workspace where AI behavior is:

- Consistent across tools.
- Traceable to requirements.
- Safer around secrets and destructive changes.
- Easier to update.
- Easier to review.
- Less dependent on one assistant vendor or IDE.
